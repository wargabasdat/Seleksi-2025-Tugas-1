He also wore silver-red armor with a high collar and a reddish-brown tailcoat. He leads an army of dragons including Kamish who was considered as the worst calamity humanity ever faced. His abilities are for example his destructive dragon breath which could even eliminate Sung Jin Woo's immortal shadow soldiers. He thought against Sung Jin Woo twice: in the first battle he compleatly overpowered Sung Jin Woo, but was beaten by the rulers in the end. The second time they fought, was because Sung Jin Woo asked the rulers to use the cup of reincarnation another time to fight Antares all by himself to reverse the losses that were made through Antares. In the end Antares also lost that battle, but through the hand of Sung Jin Woo."

His goal is to become the King of the Tower. He is blond haired, has red protrusions on the back of his head, and has a red ring with the symbol of Zahard (also known as Jahad in other translations) inscribed on it, a ring that Karaka, a FUG slayer wears. He has not displayed any special abilities with shinsu or martial arts, but was able to survive a fatal pierce through his heart in the Workshop battle when Beta tried to stop him from summoning Baam later showing a full recovery, which garnered suspicion and interest from the few people who took notice of this.

Praul married late, has two children, and wants to quit his job as principal (the pay is very high) to enjoy the rest of his life, but is forced by his wife to stay in his job and is stuck at the Academy until the twins graduate."

Her detachment from her daughter and others is at least partly due to her proficiency in silent magic."
