The first third spent on Gibbs having his 'flashbacks', which with the odd rare exception leave me wondering why they ever bother except perhaps for an easy way to fill a few minutes of broadcast time, interspersed with a clown in the operating theatre. The second third was mostly welcome back Gibbs and some filler with all the actual story and action left to the last third but if everything could be fixed that easy, why did they fail so spectacularly in earlier episodes. Even allowing suspension of disbelief for the sake of the story, does not compute. It seemed as if the writers just had no idea what to do with this episode. I really hope the quality of this episode was an aberration and not a forewarning of what is to come in the rest of the season. But if it is then this is the episode where the Series jumped the shark, and yes, it was that bad.",

It has to have hit me like a ton of bricks & yes this one has floored me and should have been an ultimately extended blockbuster movie released in major cinemas. This episode, who ever imagined & penned this work of art, then of course the direction,  production & talented cast members is w/o any doubt proof that this whole series hasn't lost one bit of its extraordinary talented staff behind its legacy  16 years of a phenomenal television series that has deserved its high ratings every single year. To come up with an episode so wonderfully written, filmed & acted so late in the series game is fantastic. In my book this series should run its total course, what ya say, another 16 years?",
