COPY public.series_trope (series_name, trope_name, trope_usage) FROM stdin;
Abnormal Summit	Fun with Foreign Languages	Frequently. In one episode Alberto teaches the other cast members a song. Yuan can't be compelled to sing along, because the refrain sounds too similar to a Chinese swear word.
Abnormal Summit	Model United Nations	Kind of...rather than making resolutions, they decide whether or not the panelist was abnormal. And there's a lot more humor in the process.
Abnormal Summit	Running Gag	Especially in the early episodes, this was drilled a lot. One could make a Drinking Game out of this.
Abnormal Summit	Screw the War, We're Partying	How Lebanon is viewed during the Middle East conflicts. Visiting intern Samer Samhoun confirms this.
ABC World News Tonight	HR Baukhage	ekdays
ABC World News Tonight	Ted Koppel	ekends
ABC World News Tonight	Human-Interest Story	During David Muir's run, he has done stories about people going through difficult times but managing to pull through, either because of illnesses like cancer or people who have died during the COVID-19 pandemic.
ABC World News Tonight	Precision F-Strike	On one outtake from 1979, Max was in Chicago, and a plane crash had just happened there. Unfortunately for him, Frank Reynolds always led off from Washington, and had that plane crash as the lead item. Max blew up in this outtake (caught on a satellite feed), with some major foul language (quote has most of the foul language redacted in blanks)...Max Robinson: Then I dare you to do that ______! How the hell do you let that man in Washington update my _______ story! There's no ______ excuse for it, _______ it—don't tell me there's one for it! I'm working my _____ off—now let's get something done out of you!
ABC World News Tonight	This Just In!	Any story that just happened late in the day will be covered before other stories will also be covered like the death of a major figure like Ruth Bader Ginsburg or George H. W. Bush.
ABC World News Tonight	Transatlantic Equivalent	News at Ten. This show came about after seeing the success of a 30-minute news broadcast like World News Tonight in the US, and went under a similar Audience-Alienating Era and an attempt to Win Back the Crowd (which was much more successful stateside).
Absalons Hemmelighed	Angel Unaware	Hubert only finds out himself that he's an angel at the very end.
Absalons Hemmelighed	Edutainment Show	Not marketed as such, but it certainly does teach history.
Absalons Hemmelighed	The Glorious War of Sisterly Rivalry	Subverted. With their sharp personality differences, and the way that their parents openly favour Ida and want Cecilie to become more outgoing and normal like her, Cecilie and Ida have all the trappings of the trope - except that they actually love and care deeply for each other.
Absalons Hemmelighed	Mysterious Waif	Hubert is a male version. He has amnesia, has no family, lives with two petty thieves, and  isn't even human.
Absolutely 1989	Spin-Off	cGlashan - a rabid Scots nationalist (played by Jack Docherty). A pilot for a  Series, “Mac”, was produced but the series wasn’t picked up. The pilot can be found here.
Absolutely 1989	the most boring man in Scotland	lum Gilhooley - Introduced as '' (played by Moray Hunter). In the first series he would always annoy his neighbour about his love for anoraks and Honda motorbikes, before pestering everyone else he spoke to in later series.
Absolutely 1989	Dirty Old Man	rt Bastard - Highly unsavoury yet strangely sympathetic , played by Sparkes and based largely on his experiences working as a carer for the elderly
Absolutely 1989	with his back to the camera at all times	e Nice Family - Ridiculously bland and beige lower-middle class family; ruled by Docherty's strangely-accented patriarch, to whom being Sensible and Tidy are the highest virtues, and consisting of Eldest Son (Sparkes), Daughter (Banks), the Twins (Hunter and Baikie), and Mother (played by Gordon Kennedy )
Absolutely 1989	Audio Adaptation	Revived on BBC Radio 4 in 2017 as The Absolutely Radio Show.
Absolutely 1989	Author Filibuster	In-universe. MacGlashan is spectacularly unsuccessful as a writer, largely because everything he writes is an excuse to have a go at the English.MacGlashan: Oh yeah? What aboot 'Traveller in Time'?McMinn: Oh yes, 'Traveller in Time', markedly different - Scotsman invents a time machine, travels back to 1965 and shoots Geoff Hurst.
Absolutely 1989	Berserk Button	The English for MacGlashan (especially English sports presenters for some reason).
Absolutely 1989	Breaking the Fourth Wall	Quite often used, but a particularly strong example was used at the end of series three which featured a character in a sketch whose false beard comes loose. He then confesses that he is just a character in a sketch wearing a costume. This is followed by a montage of all the characters in that episode removing their costumes.
Absolutely 1989	Character Catchphrase	Surprisingly for a character-based sketch show, they were largely avoided. Exceptions included Morwenna Banks' 'Little Girl' who started every monologue with 'Yes I do know what is a.....[theme of the sketch]" and ended with 'Yes it is....it's true!!!!"
Absolutely 1989	Comically Missing the Point	Gwynedd: Denzil, I have just seen Dr. Willseeyounow. Denzil: Have you? Where!? What are he doing in my house? Gwynedd: No, Denzil. I saw him at his surgery. Denzil: Gwynedd, why are you telling me this? There are nothing out of the ordinary about seeing Dr. Willseeyounow at his surgery. Gwynedd: No, Denzil. He saw me at his surgery. Denzil: Well he would do if that's where you were! Doctors are trained to notice people wandering about in their own surgeries, Gwynedd!
Absolutely 1989	Depending on the Writer	The Don & George sketches were written either by Jack Docherty or Moray Hunter separately. The writers have commented on how you can tell which is which (Jack's sketches were all about weird situations, Moray's sketches were streams of jokes).
Absolutely 1989	Driving a Desk	Parodied in the sketch where the Nice Family go out for a picnic. In the interior shot of the car, Father constantly wrenches the steering wheel back and forth in the usual manner while the back projection remains straight. Then in an exterior location shot of the car, it's weaving from side to side right across the road.
Absolutely 1989	Informed Ability	Parodied here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m7oyYGCQH4]
Absolutely 1989	Good Cop/Bad Cop	Unfortunately they can't remember what goes with Good Cop.
Absolutely 1989	The Hyena	The concept behind Pete Baikie's Laughing Man character - A rotund Pavarotti lookalike who bursts into hysterics at the sight of such things as You Don't Have To Be Mad To Work Here But It Helps signs and My Other Car Is A Porsche stickers.
Absolutely 1989	Is This Thing Still On?	After one Calum Gilhooley sketch 'ends', Michael Grade (then chief executive of Channel 4) enters the set to show some gormless VIPs around. After Moray and Jack are forced to make awkward small talk until the VIPs leave:Moray: God, they just swan in here-[Jack indicates the boom microphone is still present]Moray: ... and I'm jolly glad they do!
Absolutely 1989	Just a Stupid Accent	The accent and lyrical language of Braid Scots turns out to be Gordon Kennedy saying a few key phrases ('Oh, it cannot be') in a totally exaggerated Scottish accent.
Absolutely 1989	Karma Houdini	In one sketch, an angry Docherty and Sparkes claim the secret to this is having a sensible haircut.Sparkes: Listen! You can do anything you want as long as you've got a parting!Docherty: You can murder your wife!Sparkes: You can eat babies!Docherty: Just as long as you've got a parting![Photo of Adolf Hitler is shown]Docherty: Okay, he may have started World War Two. He may have been responsible for the Holocaust. BUT YOU COULD HAVE TAKEN HIM HOME TO MEET YOUR PARENTS!
Absolutely 1989	Knocking on Heathens' Door	Two evangelists knock on the door of Calum Gilhooley, hoping to talk about Jesus, but can't get a word in edgeways since Calum insists on monologuing about motorbikes. They then turn up in a later sketch, asking if the householders would like to hear about the Suzuki 350 ("It's a brilliant bike — faster than Jesus!")
Absolutely 1989	Large Ham	Morwenna Banks edges into this territory when playing the Little Girl. John Sparkes edges into this territory all the time (even when playing the straight man).
Absolutely 1989	Love Dodecahedron	One sketch featured this with a group of Bohemian characters attending the funeral of a companion. So involved are all their relationships that even they have forgotten who was supposed to be married to whom and who slept with whom.
Absolutely 1989	Marty Stu	nvoked Parodied with Peter Baikie's 'Mr Musak' character. He began as a parody of Richard Stilgoe, sitting at a piano and singing songs about how clever he is. By the fourth series, he is able to travel around on his piano and sort out just about any sort of problem, ranging from premature baldness to death.
Absolutely 1989	Refuge in Audacity	John Sparkes's character Frank Hovis always gave his talks to camera while sitting on a toilet. His customary self-introduction was "This is Frank Hovis" but in one sketch, that's as far as he got before giving into an extraordinarily long cascade of invisible but all-too-audible diarrhoea, which was apparently so excruciating that he couldn't speak. When it was over, he just muttered "Bye-bye" and the sketch ended.
Absolutely 1989	Reunion Show	The cast (minus Docherty due to schedule conflicts) got together in 2013 to perform a mixture of new and old sketches for the BBC radio show Sketchorama. The passage of time was lampshaded in the opening sketch, with Brucie announcing that the Stoneybridge Town Council annual meeting was "The first one for twenty years. Owing to... a reason."
Absolutely 1989	The Talk	The Nice family children receive this from their father. The entire conversation is at cross purposes, with him advising them on jobs and pensions, while they ask about flagellation and reveal they've all had sex with Derek the Scoutmaster. At the end, Father, who does not appear to have been hearing his children at all, stands up and announces to the camera:"Well! I think that went very well!" ...and faints.
Absolutely 1989	Toilet Humour	Literally with John Sparkes' 'Frank Hovis' who delivered a monologue from a toilet seat, largely about his problems with various lavatorial functions.
Absolutely 1989	What Kind of Lame Power Is Heart, Anyway?	'Schedule D Man' - who has the power to get his tax returns in on time.
Abot Kamay Na Pangarap	Adaptation Deviation	The series strays further from the movie it's based from. For starters, Lyneth's daughter lived and becomes the main protagonist.

At the end when Abby and Bill are coming to an understanding, he insists that she seal the deal by fixing him a Mai Tai. Which she does, fuming all the way. Bill then says he doesn't like Mai Tais, he just wanted to see if she could make one.
Abbys	The Comically Serious	Bill's humor derives mostly from his mute and subdued horror at the bar's craziness.
Abbys	Digging Yourself Deeper	After the weird incident of congratulating Abby on being bisexual, Bill talks to her ex Dani and finds out Dani isn't bisexual but gay. He says "Sorry" and just can't extricate himself.
Abbys	The Dreaded	There's a mute and passive elderly patron named Skip who everyone seems to live in fear of.
Abbys	Dreadful Musician	Rosie and her band, which plays "aggressive confusion".
Abbys	Embarrassing First Name	Abby is actually short for Abelarda. It's not a real Spanish name, it's a feminization of her father's name Abelardo. (The fact that they're estranged is also a factor in why she only goes by Abby.)
Abbys	Gentle Giant	James, which is inconvenient as he’s supposed to be the bouncer.
Abbys	Hands-Off Parenting	Beth is pretty straightforward about spending time at the bar in order to avoid her family, and she lets her sons do whatever crazy and destructive things they want.
Abbys	Implausible Deniability	Abby and her regulars cook up a cover story that the bar isn't actually a business. When a guy comes up to the bar, orders a beer, and gives her $3 for it, she lamely pretends she doesn't know why he's doing that.
A Black Lady Sketch Show	Bishie Sparkle	Omarion's appearances As Himself are accompanied by heavy golden sparkle effects and slo-mo.

Abbys	Right Behind Me	Abby negotiates with a rival bar for them to host Rosie's noise rock band. Abby doesn't know how much of the exchange Rosie has heard, so her explanation makes things worse.
Abbys	Skewed Priorities	Among the things Bill lost in the divorce are season tickets to the San Diego Padres. When the others try to get Bill to ask for them back for his own self-esteem, Fred can barely hide his desire for the tickets.
Abbys	This Is My Chair	In the last episode, Abby gives Bill his own stool at the bar. To inaugurate it, James sits on it just so Bill can say "You're in my seat."
Abbys	The Wonka	Abby runs an unconventional business, with an extensive list of rules based on her whims. Her customers seem to find it inviting.
A Case For Two	Claus Theo Gärtner	e detective, Josef Matula (played by  for the entirety of the show's existence), a former police officer who has ventured into the private investigation business, has a very effective and direct method, and he sometimes even resorts to dirty tricks. Gärtner reprised the role for three TV movies.
A Case For Two	Günter Strack	contrast, the attorney character has changed several times. The first was Dr. Dieter Renz (played by ). Renz retired in episode #60 and was replaced by Dr. Rainer Franck (played by Rainer Hunold). In episode #149, Dr. Franck took a job as a law school teacher, and was replaced by Dr. Johannes Voss (played by Mathias Herrmann). In episode #182, Dr. Voss was shot dead by an escaping criminal, and was in turn replaced by Dr. Markus Lessing (played by Paul Frielinghaus).
A Case For Two	Action Hero	Matula often gets into fights and chases while investigating.
A Case For Two	Character Aged with the Actor	Inevitably happened for Matula, since Claus Theo Gärtner portrayed him for 32 years straight and then some TV films.
A Case For Two	Cramming the Coffin	An episode has the criminal hides a body by killing a dog and burying it above the corpse (so when the scene is dug up, the cops only find the dog and think it's a waste of time). Only when Matula has a "Eureka!" Moment and thinks to dig deeper does he confess.
A Case For Two	Fat and Skinny	Matula always kept himself in good shape (as an Action Hero he better had to). Renz, meanwhile, was quite heavyset.
A Case For Two	Good Lawyers, Good Clients	Most of the time, the people the attorney defends turn out to be truly innocent.
A Case For Two	Instrumental Theme Tune	The show's theme by Klaus Doldinger is purely synth and electric guitar.

A Case For Two	Rhythm Typewriter	The start of the main theme is played on a typewriter.
A Case For Two	Spiritual Antithesis	Was conceived as this to Tatort. The series doesn't directly involve the police (Matula is a former cop), kept the same leading investigator and it has only one location (Frankfurt am Main), whereas Tatort directly involves the police, has had multiple leading investigators and has expanded in pretty much every major German city.
A Case For Two	Strictly Formula	Most episodes follow the same pattern: Someone get murdered, and the police arrest the most likely suspect. The suspect claims to be innocent and hires the attorney (Renz, Franck, Voss or Lessing) as his lawyer. The attorney does all the paperwork, talks with the police and attends court. Meanwhile, Matula does all the actual research and investigation work, often getting into fights and knocking out one or several bad guys, if not the true culprit. In the end, the original suspect usually (but not always) turns out to be innocent after all, and the real culprit is found.
A Case For Two	Wunza Plot	One's a private detective, one's an attorney. They solve criminal cases.

Abarenbo Shogun	Artistic License – History	As expected with a show that called itself The Chronicles of Yoshimune:
Abarenbo Shogun	Catchphrase	"Be manly to atone for this sin!" is Yoshimune's, which he delivers after defeating the villain of the week's mooks and forcing him to commit seppuku.
Abarenbo Shogun	Crapsaccharine World	Edo-era Tokyo is a place of plenty for the rich and wealthy, and a Wretched Hive under the surface, as countless corrupt bureaucrats, merchants and nobles are busy looting, bribing, robbing and brutalizing the citizens. The court games that keep trying to pull the wool over Yoshimune to keep these systems going is what forces him to go out and fight crime directly.
Abarenbo Shogun	Credits Running Sequence	Yoshimune is always seen riding a horse in each opening credits. From the second season onwards, it's usually with Mount Fuji in the background, while he rides the horse alongside a lake.
Abarenbo Shogun	Decadent Court	The Shogunate is filled with all sorts of corrupt, power-playing magistrates, chief amongst them Tokugawa Muneharu, who plots to replace Yoshimune.
Abarenbo Shogun	Dirty Coward	The villains of the week may usually act all high and mighty when bullying the commoners of Edo, and even go as far as to pay disrespect to Yoshimune... until he reveals himself.
Abarenbo Shogun	Dramatic Irony	Ooka Echizen, Yoshimune's Old Master, is frequently exasperated by his student's adventures. Ironically, another fictionalized version of Ooka was the star of his own jidaigeki series.
Abarenbo Shogun	Evil Uncle	Tokugawa Muneharu. Since he was bypassed in favor of Yoshimune to be the next shogun (despite being head of the senior Tokugawa cadet branch at the time of Yoshimune's ascension), he tries to stage a takeover of the shogunate by having Yoshimune killed.
Abarenbo Shogun	Friend to All Living Things	We Help the Helpless: Yoshimune's main character traits throughout the series, but he never seeks attention for his crime-busting ventures.
Abarenbo Shogun	King Incognito	The entire selling point of the series. Yoshimune sneaks out every night via a well to travel under his alias of Tokuda Shinnosuke to solve crimes and bring their perpetrators to justice.
Abarenbo Shogun	Modest Royalty	Yoshimune tries to reduce the Shogunate's various extravagancies, seeing them as wasteful expenses that don't interest him. As "Tokuda Shinnosuke", he finds common dishes to be a fascinating Mundane Luxury, much to the amusement of his friends.
Abarenbo Shogun	Ninja	Two of Yoshimune's agents who help him, Osono and Yabuta Sukehachi, are oniwabashu. Unlike typical depictions of ninja, they actually do their work in disguise as a musician and peddler, though they're still armed with all sorts of disguised weapons.
Ace Lightning	Damsel in Distress	Samantha, in at least four episodes. Not that she was aware of it at the time.
Abarenbo Shogun	Once per Episode	At the start of the episode, Yoshimune is typically informed about the crime-of-the-week, and sneaks out of his palace by its well. After spending most of the episode investigating the crime as Tokuda Shinnosuke, he confronts the villain, and inevitably sword duels said villain's army of mooks. Depending on the episode, he reveals that he is Yoshimune Tokugawa before or after defeating the mooks. Either way, the villain commits seppuku for his crimes (or is cut down if he refuses).
Abarenbo Shogun	Refusal of the Call	The very first scene of the first episode is Oooka Echizen informing Yoshimune of his ascension as shogun. Yoshimune is quite reluctant to take it up, given one of his predecessors was made into a political pawn. However, Ooka gives him a pep talk, saying that the country needs a righteous and just ruler. A now-inspired Yoshimune decides to take up the challenge, and thus begins the series.
Abarenbo Shogun	Set Swords to "Stun"	Yoshimune avoids going lethal where possible, striking his enemies with the blunt backside of his sword, and he's plenty skilled enough to get through whole fights like that.
Abarenbo Shogun	Sue Donym	When Yoshimune goes incognito for the first time to meet his friend Tatsugoro, the latter has to figure out to introduce former to his family, saying "Toku-", before Yoshimune quickly cuts in with "Tokuda Shinnosuke", the supposed third son of a hatamoto samurai.
Abarenbo Shogun	Stock Phrases	The villains of the week have a long list of typical "lines of rebellion" they would deliver shortly before facing Yoshimune's wrath.
Abarenbo Shogun	The Man Behind the Man	Tokugawa Muneharu, for some of the villains in the series.
Abarenbo Shogun	The Unfettered	The Unfettered Shogun, rather. Yoshimune does everything in his power to uphold the law in an unabashedly heroic manner.

Acapulco	Idiosyncratic Episode Naming	Every episode is named after a song.
Acapulco	It Will Never Catch On	In "Mamma Mia", the 1980s storyline involves the staff proposing potential retail replacements to Julia.

Acapulco	Rich Suitor, Poor Suitor	Working-class Maximo has a crush on his colleague Julia, who is dating but not 100% happy with their wealthy boss Chad.

Acapulco	Training Montage	Don Pablo gives Maximo a crash course in waiting fine dining set to a Spanish cover of "Eye of the Tiger".
Acapulco	Uptown Girl	Julia (working-class receptionist) is dating Chad (the rich resort's owner's son). Diane isn't above exploiting her son's relationship with a member of the staff to rich patrons and investors as proof of how they've "embraced the Latin American community".
Acapulco	Uncanny Family Resemblance	Actors are often recycled to show extreme family resemblance.
Acapulco	Wedding Finale	The flashbacks in the last episode of season 2 end with the wedding of Nora and Esteban. The Las Colinas crew handle the afterparty, and there is a lot of romance and sentimentality at the event.

Abbys Ultimate Dance Competition	My Nayme Is	It's pronounced "Kylie Jay", but spelled "Kyleigh Jai".
Abbys Ultimate Dance Competition	Shout-Out	The debut episode's dances were shout-outs to Michael Jackson, Beyoncé, Madonna, and Gene Kelly. Not only that, but the next episode was Lady Gaga-centric.

A Caverna Encantada	Token Minority	
About A Boy	Adaptation Expansion	The series compresses plot elements from the book and movie into a single half-hour episode. The rest of the show explores original story lines based on the sources's concepts and expands the cast in order to do so.
About A Boy	All Girls Want Bad Boys	Gender inverted; Marcus, who couldn't be more of good boy if he tried, falls head over heels for Shea Garcia-Miller when she sneaks into the principal's office and blares the Sex Pistols on the PA system.
About A Boy	Aw, Look! They Really Do Love Each Other	With their very conflicting lifestyles and values, Will and Fiona's relationship is bumpy at best. However, they will put their differences aside and help each other when needed, usually for Marcus's sake.
About A Boy	Casting Gag	Chris Diamantopolis guest stars as Marcus's new teacher and his introductory episode includes Will being psyched for a The Three Stooges marathon on TV.
About A Boy	Contraception Deception	Andy thinks Laurie is pregnant, since she's showing all the usual signs. It turns out Andy never got the vasectomy Will badgered him not to get - then "faked" a vasectomy for Laurie's benefit.
About A Boy	Disappeared Dad	Marcus's father is a penguin researcher who would rather spend months isolated at Antarctic research bases than spend time with his son.
About A Boy	Granola Girl	Fiona is a textbook example. She is a vegan, believes in homeopathic medicine, makes nearly everything she needs at home, conducts rebirthing rituals with Marcus, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.
About A Boy	Hidden Depths	Will, as it turns out, is a classically trained musician but he rarely talks about it because he associates it with his distant father.
About A Boy	Idle Rich	Will wrote a Christmas song many years before that became a hit and provides him with fat royalty checks every month. He is determined to live out the rest of his life doing whatever he wants. This lifestyle is threatened in Season 2 when someone claims to have been a co-writer on the song and the royalty payments are frozen until the issue can be sorted out.
About A Boy	Ladykiller in Love	Will finally finds himself in a happy long-term relationship with Dr. Samantha and even moves to New York with her in the first season finale.  Unfortunately, in Season 2, Dr. Sam realizes that Will misses living in San Francisco and being near Marcus so she breaks things off.
About A Boy	My Beloved Smother	When Fiona says Marcus is her whole world, she really means it. Her list of over-mothering acts includes picking all his clothes, spending hours of new-age rituals together, and trying to negotiate friends for Marcus with other mothers. The one time she lets Marcus be home alone for a couple of hours, and he accidentally stabs his foot trying to peal an orange, she goes into overdrive, placing two-way cameras around the house.
About A Boy	Papa Wolf	Will becomes very protective of Marcus and seeing Marcus get pushed around or be upset is one of the few things that gets Will riled up.
About A Boy	Parental Substitute	Although their relationship started out as a business arrangement, Marcus quickly took to Will and looks up to him. Will took a while longer to come around, but came to realize that Marcus is lacking a male role model and steps up. They maintain regular contact during the gap between Seasons 1 and 2 when Will was in New York and Will makes sure to set aside time to spend exclusively with Marcus when he visits San Francisco in the Season 2 premiere.

About A Boy	Pitbull Dates Puppy	Will's best friend, friendly and mild-mannered Andy, and his wife, aggressive and domineering Laurie.

Aaron Stone	Clothes Make the Superman	Charlie may have video game skills and be athletic, but he'd be pretty useless without his Powered Armor and gadgets.
Aaron Stone	Darker and Edgier	Season 2. Oh so much Season 2. The first episode deals with  one of the season 1 bad guys getting killed by an Eldritch Abomination with telekinesis! Sure it's off-screen and its costume looks fake and silly, but still!
Abbott Elementary	Darker and Edgier	The above-mentioned It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia crossover, including the corresponding episode in that series ("The Gang F***s Up Abbott Elementary"). While it's not especially dark overall, it does feature Mistaken for Pedophile jokes and Janine deploying a Precision F-Strike, both of which are highly unusual for Abbott. The same episodes simultaneously work as Lighter and Softer examples for Always Sunny.
Aaron Stone	Deconstructed Trope	Charlie didn't undergo any training before being sent on his first mission. Sure, he may be the best player in the game featuring the villains he's supposed to fight and he also knows some karate, but that's far from enough to be able to fight criminal masterminds. So when he goes on his first mission, he botches everything, from almost blowing his cover when the bad guys ask who he is (he responds with "I'm Charl-I mean, I'm Aaron Stone") to having said bad guys mop the floor with him. Even after he gets better, he never really learns how to use one piece of his Aaron Stone gear (his shoes).
Aaron Stone	Face Framed in Shadow	T. Abner Hall. The end of "Mutant Rain" has him reveal his face to Aaron and the rest of his team.
Aaron Stone	Fun with Acronyms	STAN, Sentient Tactical Assistant Neurohuman.
Aaron Stone	Giftedly Bad	Jason is not good at Hero Rising, putting no forethought of strategy into his gaming. In fact, he is so bad at it that his avatar Terminus Mag is as infamous at being the worst player in the world as his brother is famous for being the best. Despite constant embarrassing failures believes he is a good player and gets annoyed when pretty much everyone bluntly states he is the worst player around.
Aaron Stone	Make Way for the New Villains	The season 2 premiere has the Omega Defiance members being killed off by Damaged and his mutants.

Aaron Stone	Orange/Blue Contrast	The only two colors in title poster image are blue and orange.
Aaron Stone	Papa Wolf	Don't mess with Aaron's little brother.
Aaron Stone	Parental Abandonment	Charlie's dad is dead... Or so we're inclined to believe.
Aaron Stone	Shout-Out	The Laws of Robotics, established by Isaac Asimov, are programmed into STAN, which is often an important plot point.
Aaron Stone	Small Name, Big Ego	Jason thinks he is a good hero rising player when really he is the worst.
Aaron Stone	Villainous Rescue	The Season 2 premiere provides an inadvertent example. In-between seasons, the Omega Defiance figured out that Charlie is Aaron Stone and everything else about him. Why didn't they then attack? Well, they were getting ready to, but then Damaged and the other mutants escaped. By taking revenge against the Omega Defiance, Damaged wound up saving his soon-to-be arch-foe from almost certain death.
Aaron Stone	What Happened to the Mouse?	Dr. Necros is last seen in the second episode of season 2, being interrogated by Damaged.
Aaron Stone	Zombie Apocalypse	Dr. Necros attempted to start one in the series premiere.
Abbott Elementary	Aborted Arc	In Season 2, Melissa had her Combo Class Arc where she struggled to manage two grades in her class. But after "Candy Zombies", that problem seems to vanish as she manages her combo class pretty well. Especially after her aide Ashley vamooses.
Abbott Elementary	Accidental Passenger	The school field trip to the zoo has a slight hiccup when a student wanders off on his own. Janine ends up finding him in the basket of the hot air balloon but doesn't get off with him before it begins to fly, a terrible situation for her to be in as someone with a fear of heights.
Abbott Elementary	Actually Pretty Funny	Barbara thinks Ava's comment that Janine should be Mormon because she needs "more men" is clever enough to warrant a high five, much to Janine's dismay.Janine: Barbara!Barbara: I'm sorry, Janine, but that was actually very clever.
Abbott Elementary	Added Alliterative Appeal	Barbara delivers a passionate speech when she learns that  Gregory has been tending the garden behind her back.Barbara: "Gregory, why would you sow secretly? Why would you prune privately? Why would you cull clandestinely? Hidden hoe-ing and whatnot?"
Abbott Elementary	Aside Glance	The show is a mockumentary, and Gregory takes full advantage of the In-Universe Camera. Whenever he's displeased or surprised, he'd rather turn or look towards it than comment. Janine also frequently shoots looks at the camera.
Abbott Elementary	Bait-and-Switch	In "Mom", Jacob claims to be close with Shanae the cafeteria worker, much to Gregory's bemusement. When they visit her, she initially seems annoyed by Jacob's presence, setting up yet another joke about how Jacob isn't as cool as he thinks he is... but then they go into a greeting ritual and start happily chatting about their personal lives.
Abbott Elementary	Becoming the Mask	One of the kids dresses up as Mr. Johnson for Halloween in season 2. He gets so into character that he winds up lecturing Baby Thanos about causing a huge mess all over the school and making his job harder, then convinces the kid to turn himself in.
Abbott Elementary	Biting-the-Hand Humor	When Jacob vents about the dismal state of his relationship with Zach, he states "It's like a DC movie over here." Warner Bros. is half-owner of the series.
Abbott Elementary	Call-Back	
Abbott Elementary	Central Theme	Making the best with what you have despite the difficulties.
Abbott Elementary	Chekhov's Skill	In Season 3's "Gregory's Garden Goofballs", Ava referred to Janine Teagues as the "person who got a commercial driver's license so [they] could drive a bus in case someone went down?" Guess who ends up driving a party bus to transport students in Season 4's "Strike".
Abbott Elementary	Christmas Episode	"Holiday Hookah" shows the Abbott staff enjoying their winter break, with Janine and Greg winding up in the same nightclub while Jacob ruins Melissa and Barbara's dinner with his disdain for the holidays.
Abbott Elementary	Class Trip	Each season finale revolves around Abbott Elementary going on a field trip to a real Philadelphia location. In season one they visit the Philadelphia Zoo, in the second, the Franklin Institute, and in the third, Smith Playground (though this was the penultimate episode of the season)
Abbott Elementary	The Comically Serious	Gregory is the show's straight man, which manifests as him reacting to the antics of his students and fellow teachers with a stone-faced expression and a dry quip. Mr. Johnson also occasionally steps into the trope, such as when he threatens to sue a student who dressed as him for Halloween.
Abbott Elementary	Company Cross-References	Some episodes contain references to Disney, the parent company of ABC and half-owner of the series, as well as Marvel and Star Wars, which Disney also owns.
Abbott Elementary	Continuity Nod

Abbott Elementary	Crossover	As of season 4, this shares a universe with It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.
Abbott Elementary	Namesake Institution	Quinta Brunson named the school in the show after one of her own favorite elementary school teachers and Will Smith.
Abbott Elementary	Deadly Euphemism	Quickly played for laughs when Barbara complains that the zoo has retired her favorite tuatara to Melissa (who is heavily implied but never outright stated to come from a mob family):Melissa: Retired like my uncle Anthony, or retired [draws hand across throat] like my uncle Tony?
Abbott Elementary	Double Standard: Abuse, Female on Male	Played for laughs. From Gregory's very first day on the job, Ava constantly hits on him despite his visible discomfort and the fact that if it were a man in Ava's position of power constantly hitting on a female employee it would not be acceptable. In an early Season 1 episode, he even turns to the film crew, frantically asking if they're seeing it, as though he feels alone as nobody but him is reacting to him being harassed. Yet, it's a 'running gag' on the show continued into its second season.
Abbott Elementary	Drugs Are Bad	Invoked; in "Work Family" Tariq is enlisted to do a rap performance for an anti-drug program at the school.Tariq: ♪ I'm a sober guy, I don't get high ♪♪ If you take drugs, then you might die ♪Let's go! Come on! Bounce, bounce, yeah!
Abbott Elementary	Enthusiastic Newbie Teacher	Much of the humor stems from the contrast between idealistic and perky young 20-somethings Janine and Jacob, who have only been teaching at the titular underfunded public school for a couple years, and the more cynical and experienced older teachers Melissa and Barbara, who know from years of disappointment that the public school system will do them no favors. However, all the teachers love their students and teaching, and do their best with the resources they have.
Abbott Elementary	Epic Fail	Barbara and Jacob's attempt at starting a garden. Barbara planted the daffodils too closely, Jacob somehow mistook spinach for collard greens and tried to plant a coconut tree in subtropical Philadelphia, and neither of them even thought to label their plants or put down fertilizer and mulch. Gregory acknowledges that the only things they managed to grow without his help were some weeds.
Abbott Elementary	Everyone Can See It	Almost all of the regular characters know Janine and Gregory like each other; Janine revealed that Gregory likes her in "Valentine's Day", to no one's surprise.
Abbott Elementary	Everyone Has Standards

He claims to have competed in the Olympics and been in a relationship with Dorothy Hamill. He also may or may not have been in the Mafia at one point and was invited to the Playboy Mansion back in 1986.
Abbott Elementary	Freudian Excuse	
Abbott Elementary	Halloween Episode	
Abbott Elementary	Hard Truth Aesop	While the show has a theme of making do even in sub-optimal situations, it is also very unsubtle about telling the viewer that, in America, public schools are in dire situations and require more funding to take care of the children, especially in underprivileged neighborhoods.
Abbott Elementary	Hates Small Talk	In "Mom", we learn that Gregory is bad at small talk and doesn't see the point of it. Jacob and Melissa point out that it's actually a very useful social skill, especially for someone who wants to be in an administrative position such as principal. He manages to find something in common with Shanae at the end of the episode: they're both Orioles fans.
Abbott Elementary	Horrible at Horticulture	Jacob and Barbara set up a vegetable garden in Season 1. They are hopeless at it, so Gregory, whose father runs a Family Business in landscaping (a fact that he's hidden from them due to his own dislike of gardening), sneaks in and tends to it so the plants won't die. This gets revealed to them in Season 2 when Gregory's father Martin comes for a visit.
Abbott Elementary	Hypocritical Humor	In "Mom", Ava tells Janine not to make fun of herself, because then it's less fun for Ava when she does it.
Abbott Elementary	I Call It "Vera"	Melissa sleeps with a cut-down metal baseball bat she calls "Edith Houghton", after the MLB's first female talent scout.
Abbott Elementary	Inner City School	Abbott Elementary is a rare K-8 example. It's located in inner-city Philadelphia, has a High Turnover Rate of teachers, serves a mostly Black student body, and its funding is always at the mercy of the district. However, the teachers who do stay are earnest and hardworking, and they have students who are willing to learn.
Abbott Elementary	Intergenerational Friendship	The B-plot of "Art Teacher" is about Jacob and Barbara (who are around 30 years apart in age) bonding over gardening, bossa nova, and old movies. Likewise, he starts bonding with Melissa after he moves into her spare room in Season 3 and they learn that they have a lot in common.
Abbott Elementary	Internal Reveal	Gregory finds out about Ava  committing blackmail to get the principal job he tried to get in "Open House", which the viewers had known since the first episode. He does not take it well.
Abbott Elementary	It's Been Done	A recurring theme on the show is that the younger teachers like Janine and Jacob frequently attempt to implement some new, innovative idea for the school to improve things for the students that seasoned staff members like Barbara and Melissa disapprove of because they've seen similar ideas attempted in the past and know from experience they don't work.
Abbott Elementary	Know When to Fold 'Em	Ava nearly talks herself into a fight with Janine's mom Vanetta by insulting Janine in front of her. Upon recognizing that Vanetta is ready to start swinging, she quickly makes her exit.Ava: The key to never getting your ass beat? Knowing when someone can beat your ass.
Abbott Elementary	Leaning on the Fourth Wall	In one episode, Janine describes one of her strengths as knowing when to "pause for laughter," before waiting a beat (exactly long enough for the actual audience to laugh) and saying, "See?".
Abbott Elementary	Mama Bear	Vanetta may be a neglectful freeloader, but she squares up when Ava insults Janine. In the same episode, Barbara steps in when she becomes worried that Vanetta is going to guilt-trip Janine into giving up her vacation money so Vanetta can pay her phone bill, defending Janine and even offering to give Vanetta the money herself.
Abbott Elementary	Mocking Music	When Ava finds out that the Superintendent married the woman he had an affair with and thus her blackmail on him is useless and she needs to shape up and be an actual principal or be fired, she plays Mary J. Blige 's "I'm Goin' Down".
Abbott Elementary	Mockumentary	The teachers are indeed being followed around by a documentary crew documenting the struggles of teachers in the public school system. This gets weaponized against them in "Attack Ad", when the teachers find out that Legendary Charters was able to get footage for their negative ad by sending in a fake camera crew.
Ace Lightning	Downer Ending	Several episodes, including April Fools and Unidentified Flying Superhero.
Abbott Elementary	Newscaster Cameo	One from Philly's legendary news anchor Jim Gardner (not coincidentally, the anchor at the ABC station in town, WPVI-TV). Quinta Brunson later made an appearance during WPVI's Thanksgiving Day Parade coverage (not long before Gardner officially retired in December of 2022), and both geeked out over each other.
Abbott Elementary	Not So Above It All	Despite his best efforts, Gregory eventually gets sucked into caring about his students, his job, and Abbott Elementary.
Abbott Elementary	Not What It Looks Like	Janine and Gregory's first meeting in the pilot. Janine walks into one of the bathrooms with a sick student in tow and sees a strange man emerging from a stall with a pair of child's pants in his hand. She naturally freaks out until Gregory manages to explain himself (one of his students had to go to the bathroom and wet his pants).Janine: Random man! Child pants! Security!
Abbott Elementary	Now Allowed to Hug	From the start of the series, the emotive and enthusiastic Jacob attempts to befriend the more serious and reserved Gregory, with Gregory being reluctant partially out of professionalism and partially due to finding Jacob weird. However, over the course of the series, after getting to know each other better and working together the two get genuinely closer. In the season two finale, after Gregory talks to Jacob about his feelings for Janine and confides  the fact they kissed at the PECSA conference, with Jacob encouraging him to tell her how he feels, the two share a brief "bro hug" as a sign of how far they've come.
Abbott Elementary	Oh, Crap!	When  Ava realizes that the superintendent got remarried to the deaconess, making her blackmail material useless.
Abbott Elementary	O.O.C. Is Serious Business	When Ava opens the meeting in the Season 3 premiere by politely asking Gregory to read from his binder and not harassing him, everyone is taken aback.
Abbott Elementary	Precision F-Strike	When Barbara finally gives up on trying to get through to Draemond. The swear itself is quite mild, but considering it's coming from prim and proper Barbara, who's consistently been the most forgiving towards him, it stands out.Barbara: But at the end of the day, [the students] have to decide who they want to be. And this one chose to be a jackass.
Abbott Elementary	Queer Establishing Moment	Jacob mentions his boyfriend of two years in "Work Family", though his sexuality was hinted at in a previous episode.
Abbott Elementary	Running Gag	
Abbott Elementary	Same Race Means Related	In the twelfth episode Jacob (the young, earnest, but clueless white teacher) expresses admiration for a Black teacher, Mrs. Davis, and says that the only way she could be any cooler was if she was related to Angela Davis. He then backtracks, claiming that it's not because he thinks all Black people are related.Gregorynote also Black: Well, maybe you do. Maybe that's your subconscious speaking.[makes a knowing Aside Glance, indicating that he's messing with Jacob]
Abbott Elementary	Self-Care Epiphany	The aesop of "Light Bulb"; Janine is so determined to support her boyfriend's music career, fix the lighting in the school, and prove herself that she ends up fainting because she skips both breakfast and lunch.
Abbott Elementary	Shout-Out	
Abbott Elementary	Significant Name Overlap	invokedUsed for a gag in "Wrong Delivery". Barbara has a habit of mixing up white and Black celebrities (eg. saying Carrie Underwood instead of Kerry Washington, or Michael B. Jordan instead of Michael J. Fox). When she praises "Michelle Williams" as a "diva" her coworkers are gleeful because she actually correctly referred to a Black celebrity...only for her to loop back around and praise Michelle Williams's Oscar nominations.Janine: So close.
Abbott Elementary	Silver Vixen	Both Melissa and Barbara are visibly older than the other teachers, but that doesn't stop them from being gorgeous, something that the show points out repeatedly, especially in regards to Melissa, with multiple outfits designed to show off her curves.Melissa (to Barbara): My opinion - you've gotten better with age, like good wine and Stanley Tucci.
Abbott Elementary	Sitcom Arch-Nemesis	
Abbott Elementary	Sliding Scale of Idealism Versus Cynicism	On the idealism side, there's Janine and Jacob, who are still passionate about teaching and find various ways to work outside the system for their jobs. Barbara and Melissa are are on the cynicism side: they're both competent teachers, but far more jaded after spending years in the public school system dealing with low funding and apathetic faculty and parents.
Abbott Elementary	Stern Teacher	Downplayed; Barbara keeps her students extremely well-behaved, but she's not cruel or menacing, and she has the respect of her students and the other teachers.
Abbott Elementary	Story Arc	
Abbott Elementary	Sucky School	Downplayed; the teachers of Abbott Elementary are generally skilled and passionate about teaching, but they're stymied by their principal, the district, and their general lack of funding. The school itself is also falling apart, with many things needing repair.
Abbott Elementary	Surprisingly Realistic Outcome	Many of the episodes are about a teacher (usually Janine) trying some new, groundbreaking, innovative idea for teaching, only to hit the cruel ceiling of reality and have to settle for something tried-and-true.
Abbott Elementary	Take a Third Option	In "The Principal's Office," Gregory has a hard time with Micah, a student in his class who can't pay attention and repeatedly derails the lesson plan. After numerous attempts to solve the problem, Gregory feels like he can either ignore Micah entirely (to the detriment of the rest of the class, who are also annoyed by his antics) or send him the principal's office (which doesn't help him at all). Eventually, though, Gregory finds a different way to solve the problem: he integrates Micah's favorite TV show into the lessons, which calms him down enough to focus while still providing genuine educational content.
Abbott Elementary	Take That!	The show takes the time to criticize different elements that contribute to the hardships of not just teachers but also their students, from self-serving school boards and lack of funding to the charter school system.
Abbott Elementary	Talking Is a Free Action	The teachers will often have conversations during or even in front of their classes without the students seeming to care (unless it's important to the plot).
Abbott Elementary	Time Skip	"Career Day" takes place five months after the school year started, due to the documentary crew having their equipment stolen. This is to justify the late start of the season due to the WGA/SAG strikes the previous summer.
Abbott Elementary	Token White	
Abbott Elementary	Took a Level in Cynic	Gregory briefly becomes disaffected and borderline nihilistic when he finds out that Ava got the principal job by  blackmailing the superintendent, ranting to the camera about how nothing really matters and how there's no point in putting effort into anything.
Ackley Bridge	The Good Old British Comp	Ackley Bridge is this, only it is an academy and not a proper comprehensive.
Abbott Elementary	Umbrella of Togetherness	After the others make fun of Janine for only dating one guy her entire life, she takes off and leaves the building. Gregory, who has been implied to have a crush on her, goes after her, grabs an umbrella from the hallway, and briefly comforts her as they stand under it in the rain.
Abbott Elementary	Valentine's Day Episode	The titular episode shows each of the Abbott staff facing different tribulations making the day a success with their special somebodies.
Abbott Elementary	Volleying Insults	Discussed in one episode in which Jacob, the Token White teacher, struggles to participate in games of the Dozens with his students due to having no cultural context for it (and being a Nice Guy). This results in him being clowned by a group of children. The best insults he can come up with are pointing out that his opponent is wearing school uniform and sneakers, same as every other kid, which only gets him roasted harder. Gregory attempts to help him out. At the end of the episode Gregory, too, refers to Jacob as "Ol' Siskel & Ebert two-thumbs-up-lookin'-ass boy" behind his back.
Abbott Elementary	We Want Our Jerk Back!	In "Career Day", Ava reveals that she spent the summer doing an online education program to become a more responsible principal. At first the teachers are happy, but then Ava institutes changes like changing the seating in Barb's classroom and prohibiting free periods and outside lunches.

Ace Of Cakes	The Alcoholic	
Ace Of Cakes	All Just a Dream	The end of the final episode parodies this.
Ace Of Cakes	And the Rest	The opening credits feature caricatures labelled with each person's name. However, for the first episode, after Mary Alice and Geof, they had one drawing of three people labelled "The Girls". Later episodes used the same drawing, but with separate labels ("Mary", "Katherine", and "Anna").
Ace Of Cakes	And Your Reward Is Clothes	Sort of: As a thank-you for the Squig cake, Duff got a custom MMORPG avatar.
Ace Of Cakes	Benevolent Boss	Duff is this to his employees—he's a genuinely Nice Guy in Real Life and does a lot for his employees, many of whom he was already friends with prior to starting his business.
Ace Of Cakes	Carrying a Cake	Dropped cakes are very rare, but have happened. What happens more often than not is that the cake will self-destruct (collapsing, fondant cracking and/or sagging, the environment damaging the decorations, and other mishaps). There was also the time that the horribly unprofessional maid staff at a hotel in which they were staying prior to a delivery cut up their sheet cakes and ate them. They were able to provide sheet cakes after a local bakery let them use their kitchen.
Ace Of Cakes	Close-Enough Timeline	Parodied in the final episode, which had a Back to the Future-theme, where screwing around with the bakery's flux capacitor caused the bakers to become office workers, bugs, and random hazmat suit (really painter's suits) wearers. Really screwing up the flux capacitor caused Geof and Duff to become workers at a cake box factory.
Ace Of Cakes	Crossover	Kate + Eight visited as a surprise for Kate; Guy Fieri came in for an episode of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives on Baltimore and Duff treated him to a giant cake shaped like a giant hamburger; Geof and Duff made an anniversary cake for King of the Hill and had cameos on the show; the crew traveled to Hawaii to simultaneously work on cakes for Lost's wrap party and a US military base (both groups loved it). The cast of Avenue Q came into the bakery, puppets and all, while they were making a cake for the show.
Ace Of Cakes	Deadpan Snarker	Just about everyone, but especially Geof.
Ace Of Cakes	Does Not Like Spam	Duff despises cupcakes despite (or maybe because of) trying to make the world's largest cupcake and failing. He stated that one of the reasons he hates them is because "people who make cupcakes think they can bake."
Ace Of Cakes	Earn Your Happy Ending	Combined with the above, Duff forced himself to make 52 cupcakes for the New York Rangers hockey team so he could "earn" being involved with his favorite sport.
Ace Of Cakes	Everyone Is Christian at Christmas	Duff's Jewish, and in a Christmas Episode, he found it very amusing that he was the one who got everyone into the holiday spirit (with fireworks, of course).
Ace Of Cakes	Everything's Better with Sparkles	Mostly cakes in the early episodes.
Ace Of Cakes	Everything's Deader with Zombies	Quite a few times, especially around Halloween. They once made an exception to their "no portraits" rule when the client added "—and his brains are being eaten by zombies."
Ace Of Cakes	Evolving Credits	Since Charm City Cakes' staff increased over the series' run, and a lot more of them appeared on camera, the later seasons' credits noticeably changed to reflect this.

Absolutely Fabulous	Big "YES!"	In “Fat”, Edina lets out one after Patsy tells her that Penny, an old acquaintance who used to mock her weight, is now blind.
Ace Lightning	Bedsheet Ghost	Chuck terrifies the living daylights out of the bad guys when he gets caught in a sheet while they're raiding Mark's house.
Ace Of Cakes	Fandom Rivalry	In-Universe, Mary the decorator is a major, possibly lone New York Yankees fan among many Boston Red Sox fans, the most vehement of which is Mary Alice the secretary.Mary, upon spotting a Red Sox flag that would decorate a New Yankee Stadium cake: "What is that awful, ugly flag doing there? (replaces it with a Yankees flag) There, that's better!"Mary Alice, through clenched teeth: I don't think she realizes how many Red Sox fans there are here. Including me.
Ace Of Cakes	Former Teen Rebel	Played with in Duff's case—he's still a rebel, just in a more focused and mostly law-abiding way.
Ace Of Cakes	Heterosexual Life-Partners	Duff and Geof.
Ace Of Cakes	Incendiary Exponent	Unless client specifically states that they don't want fireworksnote There was at least one episode where Duff was making a wedding cake for a close friend of his, who very clearly stated that she didn't want any fireworks shooting out of her cake (or for it to move/spin around). After hearing this, Duff (reluctantly but respectfully) agreed to make a "normal" cake for her, Duff never misses a chance to shoot off fireworks and given even kist half a chance, he will find a way to put fireworks into (or at least onto) a cake.
Ace Of Cakes	Kindhearted Cat Lover	Several members of the staff (including Duff) have pet cats. Elena even has a "Mt. Cutemore" photoshop of her cats.
Ace Of Cakes	The Knights Who Say "Squee!"	Despite having a successful television show, Duff and co. geek out quite shamelessly when meeting other famous faces.

Ace Of Cakes	One-Steve Limit	Averted.
Ace Of Cakes	Parody	The 100th episode included several parodies of other TV-series, like The Hills, The Real World, Undercover Boss and The A-Team.
Ace Of Cakes	Perma-Stubble	Duff's typical appearance aside from his goatee.
Ace Of Cakes	Platonic Life-Partners	The entire staff could qualify, but the two "pairs" that especially give off this vibe are Duff and Mary Alice, and Ben and Katherine.
Ace Of Cakes	Product Displacement	
Ace Of Cakes	Product Placement	
Ace Of Cakes	Sassy Secretary	Mary Alice, who's the general manager at Charm City Cakes—similar to Geof, Mary Alice serves as Duff's second-in-command and handles most of the businessy-aspects of Charm City Cakes (such as organizing appointments with clients). Mary Alice has also claimed to be one of the few people to have the ability "to get Duff to do what he's supposed to do."
Ace Of Cakes	Serial Escalation	Regularly.
Ace Of Cakes	Shown Their Work	In addition to the process of actually making the cakes, for big or unusual commissions, they'll do "research" for it. Examples:
Ace Of Cakes	Square-Cube Law	Invoked in the giant cupcake episode—Duff's original plan was to just make a really big cupcake, but after crunching the numbers, he and the rest of the staff realized that there was no way it'd be able to support its own weight.
Ace Of Cakes	Squick	Invoked—Adam (one of the primary chefs at Charm City Cakes) practices veganismnote By definition, a vegetarian is someone who simply doesn't eat meat—a "vegan," on the other hand, is someone who doesn't eat anything that comes from an animal. This includes not only meat, but also stuff like eggs, dairy products and honey and was a little grossed out upon having to handle hotdogs while helping his boss make cheesy blasters.
Ace Of Cakes	The Stoner	Geof appears to be stoned a lot of the time when doing his talking-head shots.
Ace Of Cakes	Take That!	To their TLC counterparts: "You need to be the ''boss'' of the cake". "You (the puppet bakers) aren't working out, I'm bumping you to the minor leagues"—stuffed in a box with a "Jersey Or Bust" sign (if they really went there, they'd be returned covered in flour and dipped in icing).
Ace Of Cakes	True Companions	The staff of Charm City Cakes—as mentioned above, Duff was friends with quite a few of his staff prior to starting his business, and even though Duff's technically their boss, he seems to see his staff more as friends than his employees.
Ace Of Cakes	Wacky Marriage Proposal	A few times—the CCC-staff have been commissioned to make "proposal cakes" for some of their customers, and in at least one episode, Duff offered the client a 10% discount on a wedding cake if the guy's girlfriend said "yes" to his proposal.
Absolutely Fabulous	Abusive Parents	
Absolutely Fabulous	Actor Allusion	Patsy appeared in a series of James Bond porn parodies as Honey Lovetrap. Lumley was an actual Bond Girl in On Her Majesty's Secret Service.
Absolutely Fabulous	Adam Westing	Pop singer Lulu and actress Twiggy as Edina's celebrity clients
Absolutely Fabulous	The Alcoholic	Both Edina and Patsy. The two do obscene amounts of booze and drugs.
Absolutely Fabulous	Alliterative Family	By chance, the main cast made up one of these: Jennifer Saunders, Joanna Lumley, Julia Sawalha, June Whitfield and Jane Horrocks.
Absolutely Fabulous	All Just a Dream	"Iso-Tank", which features an actually competent Bubble and ends with Edina accidentally adopting a massive amount of Romanian babies before she wakes up and is told that she only spent 30 seconds inside aformentioned iso-tank.
Absolutely Fabulous	And I'm the Queen of Sheba	When Saffy downplays Edina's weight issues, Bubble glumly responds "And I'm Dolly Parton".

Absolutely Fabulous	Always Camp	The vast majority of fashion icons Edina and Patsy encounter in their careers.

Absolutely Fabulous	Big "NO!"	Saffron lets one loose in "Menopause" as she watches in horror at Patsy prepares to mix her eggs with Mick Jagger's sperm to have a baby. Then she wakes up.
Absolutely Fabulous	Bilingual Bonus	The punchline of "France" is that Patsy and Edina have been staying in a run-down French cottage when they were supposed to be in a ritzy chateau. Three times during the episode, a French man tries to explain this to them. Any audience members who speak French will have figured this out about 20 minutes before the characters do.
Absolutely Fabulous	Black Comedy	Edina's treatment of Saffron constitutes full-on abuse at times and it's always Played for Laughs.
Absolutely Fabulous	Black Comedy Rape	In "Morocco", Saffron being molested by a much older man is played completely for laughs. The same episode has Patsy saying one of the reasons one goes to the titular country is to have sex with "gorgeous underage youths".
Absolutely Fabulous	Bratty Teenage Daughter	Inverted. Saffron is by far the most moral character. Edina, on the other hand, is what happens when this trope grows up and has children of her own. The series was at least partly born out of a French and Saunders sketch of this reversal.
Absolutely Fabulous	British Brevity	On for eight years total, only 36 episodes.
Absolutely Fabulous	Broken Pedestal	Patsy always looked up to her sister Jackie, who would push the limits of Hard-Drinking Party Girl further than even Patsy did. She is horrified to learn that Jackie is no longer one of these, and wants to start a home for stray cats and dogs.
Absolutely Fabulous	Bumbling Sidekick	Bubble, who takes this to new heights of incompetence. Edina keeps her around only because Bubble makes her look good. In a newer episode, "Job", Bubble tells the new intern she keeps her job not because of what she does not know, but because of what she DOES know. Thoroughly averted in the film, in which Bubble is shown to be quite well off as a result of her handling of Edina’s chaotic business over the years.
Absolutely Fabulous	Buxom Beauty Standard	The only thing Patsy approves of regarding Saffron is that the latter has "quite big tits".note When Edina tricks Saffron into exposing them in front of a photographer, she instantly gets a magazine deal offer. Bubble is also jealous of Edina's "great, big, large, pendulous breasts", while they only serve as reminders to Edina that she's fat.
Absolutely Fabulous	Cloudcuckoolander	The entire main cast (except Saffron) to various extents, but most obviously Bubble.
Absolutely Fabulous	Coming Out To The Spouse	Justin, Eddie's second husband and Saffy's father, came out as gay and now runs an antique shop with his partner Oliver.
Absolutely Fabulous	Covert Pervert	In "Morocco", a much older man offers to cover Saffron's "naked, nubile young body" in honey and goat's cheese and lick it off her, much to her disgust. Later on, Saffron eyes up a handsome young waiter. At the end, she and the waiter exchange a look that suggested something might have happened between them, and a moment later... (which causes Saffron to go crimson with embarrassment and run off.)Edina: What's that smell? What's that smell? Is that you, sweetie? That sort of honey, yoghurty smell? Is that you?
Absolutely Fabulous	Crossover	
Absolutely Fabulous	Crosses the Line Twice	An in-universe example: Saffron writes a serious, autobiographical play that's supposed to be a scathing attack on her mother's neglect, but instead becomes a hit comedy that everyone (including Edina) loves because the characters of Edina and Patsy are as ridiculous as their inspirations. Taking it even further, the Patsy character is played by a Drag Queen.

Absolutely Fabulous	Deadpan Snarker	Saffron and Patsy, although most characters have their moments.

Absolutely Fabulous	Establishing Character Moment	Shortly after her first appearance in the first episode, Patsy reacts to seeing Saffy as though she stepped in something foul, indicating their relationship for most of the rest of the series.
Absolutely Fabulous	Fag Hag	Edina claims that all her friends are gay. This isn't true. She is devastated to learn that Saffron isn't gay. Likewise, she is disappointed that Serge isn't Camp Gay but Straight Gay, and instead adopts Serge's campier boyfriend Martin, who is all too happy to have Edina as a hag.
Absolutely Fabulous	Fashionable Evil	If Patsy has a D&D-style alignment, this is it.
Absolutely Fabulous	Frothy Mugs of Water	Ginger ale is substituted for champagne. A gag reel, however, shows the side effects of using real wine over multiple takes...
Absolutely Fabulous	Frozen Face	Happened to Eddy due to too much of a Botox-like injection.
Absolutely Fabulous	Gaussian Girl	In "Hospital", Patsy has a fantasy of what she'll look like after her face-lift.
Absolutely Fabulous	Get a Hold of Yourself, Man!

Absolutely Fabulous	The Ghost	Edina's son Serge for the majority of the series. Whenever some important event occurred, he was "taking lava samples in Sumatra" or some similar scientific activity to explain his absence.

Absolutely Fabulous	Granola Girl	Bo (played by Mo Gaffney).

Absolutely Fabulous	Heterosexual Life-Partners	Edina and Patsy. Patsy in particular seems lost whenever they are apart.
Adolescence	The Oner	Every episode takes place in one long shot, with no breaks.
Absolutely Fabulous	Hilariously Abusive Childhood	Saffron had one, which included being abandoned in the park, used to stub out cigarettes by Patsy, and more emotional neglect than seems humanly possible. Now that she's grown and still lives with her mother, she's undergoing a Hilariously Abusive Adulthood (though she has by now learned to fight back).
Absolutely Fabulous	Home Porn Movie	In "Sex", there's one shot with Patsy and Edina participating in an orgy back in the 60's. It mistakenly gets shown by Saffron in a school lecture hall instead of her own tape on genetics.
Absolutely Fabulous	I Want You to Meet an Old Friend of Mine	Saunders' comedy partner Dawn French appears in "Magazine".
Absolutely Fabulous	I Was Never Here	In "Door Handle", Saffron helps Patsy with a brief breast self-exam. Gran passes by the door, looks wide-eyed at what they're doing and moves on without a word.

You orbit planet you! You're your own moon. You moon yourself.
Absolutely Fabulous	Lady Looks Like a Dude	Patsy has been repeatedly mistaken for a crossdresser. The fact that she once lived as a man during The '70s may be a factor.
Absolutely Fabulous	Language Barrier	The girls decide to check out a chateau in France, only to be dropped off at a rustic cottage. They spend a week in miserable conditions with a strange man coming around constantly, speaking French and scaring them. Saffy finally picks them up with Bubble as the man returns, and Bubble speaks French. She tells a stunned Patsy that the man is wondering why the girls are waiting in this crummy shack when the staff of the upscale chateau down the road has been waiting for them all week. Patsy warns Bubble to never mention this to anyone.
Absolutely Fabulous	Large Ham	Edina. So much. Moreso in the early seasons, wherein a shocking reveal would result in Kramer-esque flailing and collapsing to the floor.
Absolutely Fabulous	Like Parent, Like Spouse	Not only did Serge turn out like Saffron, but his partner Martin behaves exactly like Edina.
Absolutely Fabulous	Love Martyr	Saffron. Any sane, rational person would have run as far as humanly possible from her mother, but she largely stays by her side out of maternal devotion and a firm belief that if she were to turn her back on her mother, Edina would be dead due to her stupidity.
Absolutely Fabulous	Magical Defibrillator	In "Cold Turkey", a doctor not only uses one to restart Patsy's heart, but applies it on top of both her clothing and a blanket.
Absolutely Fabulous	Malicious Misnaming	Edina relentlessly calls Sarah "Titicaca".

Absolutely Fabulous	My Beloved Smother	The reason Serge moved out is because Edina was one of these. Quite literally, as she often would hold Serge so tightly to herself he would almost suffocate.
Absolutely Fabulous	New-Age Retro Hippie	Edina, who will jump on any fad known to man, but is especially fond of anything that reminds her of her teenaged years in the '60s.
Absolutely Fabulous	"Not So Different" Remark	A shared look rather than a verbal remark, but in "Happy New Year", Eddy and Saffy make the same snarky comment about Patsy at once, and then stare at each other in a sort of surprise.Patsy: I promise you, darling. On my honour.Saffy: Patsy's honour?Eddy and Saffy: (in unison) Send out the search party.
Absolutely Fabulous	Old Shame	In-Universe. In "Sex", a trip into Serge's room has Edina, Patsy and Saffron finding a men's magazine among Serge's belongings.

Absolutely Fabulous	Older Than They Look	"Happy New Year" features Patsy's estranged sister Jackie (Kate O'Mara), who claims to be the younger of the two. At the end, she reveals that she is actually 72. Patsy is horrified: "Then how old does that make me?!" In the audio commentary for one episode, Saunders theorises that Patsy has so many chemicals in her body that she is somehow preserved like a mummy. Eddy lampshaded it In-Universe, too.Eddy: She's a testament to the power of prescription drugs!

They pass it over in silence and watch as she actually eats it. Then promptly chokes.

Absolutely Fabulous	Psychopathic Manchild	Seriously played with Patsy.
Absolutely Fabulous	Raging Stiffie	Except what's stiff is someone's tongue.
Absolutely Fabulous	Rich Bitch	Edina may qualify, although she also tends to hate this sort of character.
Absolutely Fabulous	Rich in Dollars, Poor in Sense	Edina. Her ex-husbands cut her off in "Poor" when they find out she has been scamming them for years, and she fears becoming poor. But it turns out that even without them she's still wealthy — Saffron just lets her think she'll be poor to teach her a lesson. Doesn't work.
Absolutely Fabulous	Road Trip Across the Street	Edina and Patsy get into a car to go to a spa, which is only on the other side of the road.

Absolutely Fabulous	The Stinger	Many episodes come with an additional scene after the end credits.

Absolutely Fabulous	Studio Audience	Most episodes were filmed in front of a live audience, save for the various on location shoots.

They enter the room to find a covered body... then Patsy emerges from another room and reveals that Jackie overdosed on heroin the night before.

Absolutely Fabulous	Tropaholics Anonymous	Saffron sets up a Menopausals Anonymous meeting for Edina and Patsy. Naturally, neither want any part of it.
Absolutely Fabulous	Ultimate Job Security	Patsy got her job as the editor of a fashion magazine by sleeping with the publisher, and the position requires so little of her that she shows up there only a couple of times a year, and even then only to claim free clothes and other giveaways. It takes the magazine going out of business to dislodge her from it, and she immediately gets another job at a high-fashion store which requires even less work on her part, as it actively discourages customers.
Absolutely Fabulous	The Un-Favourite	Edina seems at times to actively hate Saffron, while pining for her son Serge. Subverted when he finally makes an appearance and it turns out he may have had an even more Hilariously Abusive Childhood than Saffron, and fled to the other side of the globe to escape her, having the rest of the family lie about his whereabouts for years.
Absolutely Fabulous	Visit by Divorced Dad	Edina has two ex-husbands, and a child by each of them. Both became recurring characters and visited frequently.

According To Jim	Sequel Episode	"The Grill II" to "the Grill" natch.

A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Camp Gay	Simbold Cleobury of the "My Dear Boy" sketch, who opens the door with that enthusiastic greeting—he's theoretically a painter who wears a dressing-gown, dyes his hair lavender, fills his house with louche art and tigerskin rugs, and boasts that his "Moroccan Sunrise" cocktail has caused many a son of Morocco to rise. And also places adverts for (nude male) models in an magazine about (plastic aeroplane) models.

According To Jim	Spoiling Shout-Out	Jim spoils The Sixth Sense to Andy while he's watching to get him to come over.

According To Jim	Stealth Insult	A meta example towards Cosmopolitan magazine. Drinking Cosmo makes you a yandere, hmm.
According To Jim	St. Patrick's Day Episode	In "The Thin Green Line," Cheryl gives her best to assure herself a spot on the Church Committee. In order to do so, she forbids Jim to do his annual "Green Man" routine on St. Patrick's day. However, her plans are ruined when she gets arrested.
According To Jim	Strictly Formula	Most episodes could be described as "Jim does something dishonest/selfish and tries to hide it from Cheryl, she finds out about it and tries to force him to admit it, lather rinse, repeat."
According To Jim	Sure, Let's Go with That	what with this show heavily relying on wacky antics, this is pretty much a given. Case in point - the episode with Andy buying... er, "second-hand" jewels for his fiancée, and then sharing the same plan with Jim. When Cheryl asks Jim if that was in order to make it the "best birthday ever", he pretty much goes with that hypothesis.
According To Jim	Throw the Dog a Bone	Despite all the crap that happens to him throughout the series, Andy finally got engaged to his girlfriend in the series finale.
According To Jim	What Happened to the Mouse?	In "The Cat Came Back" the family acquires a new dog Jim names Gary Sinise. He appears in a few episodes and then disappears without any explanation (although a bag of dog food can be seen in the background of several episodes after that)

A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Aside Glance	In Hugh's "Protest Song", every time he gets to the bit where he has to sing exactly what it is that everyone must do (which he hasn't worked out, so he just mumbles instead), he gives one of these to the camera.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Astonishingly Appropriate Interruption	The entire "Understanding Barman" sketch is based on this, with Stephen (as the titular barman) interrupting Hugh's complaining about his wife to offer him various drinks, snacks or other things, with the offers sounding like he's finishing Hugh's sentences.Hugh: Other men have bigger-Stephen: [offering Hugh a couple of] Plums?Hugh: -prospects.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Awesome Anachronistic Apparel	The politician and Tony from "Tony of Plymouth" are wearing suit jackets over Renaissance garb, as they reveal when they confront each other on stage.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Bait-and-Switch	Done when Stephen has punched Hugh to stop him from performing a particularly annoying song about a missing jar lid (which turns out to be stuck in the couch cushions). Stephen quickly shifts into presenting a tribute to "the late Hugh Laurie", complete with testimonials from other actors and friends. Rowan Atkinson delivers it:Rowan Atkinson: [fondly] He was an immensely dangerous man, a very dangerous actor. You know, whenever he was around, there was always this feeling of "ooh, anything could happen." [pause, dismissively] Hugh Laurie, on the other hand, was one of the dullest men I've ever met.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Big Ball of Violence	As close as can be achieved when doing so with live actors in the Strom Translation sketch. Most of it happens behind a convenient table when the translator attacks the Englishman, but the random and unlikely leaping and appearance of various limbs only needs the cartoon dust cloud to complete it.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	"Blackmail" Is Such an Ugly Word	"I dislike the word brothel, Mr. Jowett. I prefer to use the word brothels. Yes, this is a brothels".
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Boring Vacation Slideshow	One sketch had a man (played by Stephen Fry) be forced to listen as another man (played by Hugh Laurie) shows him extremely boring photos of a holiday as punishment for sleeping with his daughter. The father warns him if he does it again, there'll be a slideshow.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Brick Joke	Paul Eddington makes a cameo and is asked how he would rate his own comic timing.

Roll credits.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	British Royal Guards	The opening of the second season sees Fry and Laurie playing with a guard. The guard charges Laurie when he gets too close.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Butt-Monkey	
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Calvinball	Bushwallyta. The only rule that's clearly explained is that when the referee shouts "Bo-Yayinha!", the players must assemble a working picnic chair from whatever materials are currently available.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Freeze-Frame Ending	Parodied in the pilot episode. The final sketch is a send-up of terrible Australian soap operas, and ends with a dumb joke and a freeze frame...except that the camera is still rolling. The credits roll in their entirety while Hugh does a ridiculous expression and Stephen balances on one foot.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Chewbacca Defense	A deliberately ridiculous example in the sketch "Judge Not". It starts:Lawyer: So, Miss Talliot, you expect the court to believe that on the evening of the fourteenth of November last year, the very year, I would remind the court, on which the crime that my client is accused of committing took place, you just happened to be walking in the park?Witness: That is correct.Lawyer: That is what? Witness: Correct.Lawyer: Oh it's correct, is it? I see. I wonder, Miss Talliot, whether you were aware that the American novelist Gertrude Stein was a self-confessed lesbian?
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	The Chosen One	Parodied in "A Word, Timothy" — Timothy's father claims that his son is the prophecied wielder of Berwhale the Avenger (a swiss army knife) who will defeat Pewnack the Dark One... all as an excuse to stop Timothy being a Basement Dweller and get him to leave the house.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Cloche Surprise	In one sketch, taking place in a posh restaurant, Fry orders "Chicken a la Croix, prepared at the table". When the food arrives, Laurie, playing the waiter, takes off a cloche to reveal a live chicken — "prepared at the table" includes watching the chicken being slaughtered. Fry is put off and orders a salad instead.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Cluster F-Bomb	ohn: "Dammit Peter, maybe you're right." Peter: "You're damn right maybe I'm right." John: "Damn, double damn, and an extra pint of damn for the weekend!"
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Cloud Cuckoo Lander	Oh so many, but perhaps the most notable example is Mr. Dalliard's Friend. "I opened my television last night only to find that nice gentleman with the legs advancing the prediction that it might be rather 'good evening' today, but looking out through the window that the previous owners thoughtfully installed for the purpose, I find that it has, as you athletically observed, turned out to be rather 'hello'."
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Compensating for Something	One character whose genitals have been removed is offered a doberman, a combat jacket, a subscription to Guns and Ammo and a rusty white van, for the dual purpose of restoring his manhood and when the patient asks how he is supposed to urinate...Doctor (Laurie): Oh don't worry, that's the beauty of the system. When people see you wearing a combat jacket and driving round in a white van with Killer, the piss will be taken out of you constantly.

A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Crazy-Prepared	One sketch features Hugh Laurie (in drag) running a shop selling greetings cards with a range of highly specific messages, even down to Stephen Fry's request for a joint birthday and get-well card (as his wife is liable to jealous spasms every time his daughter has a birthday). Sadly, the name on the card is wrong, but fortunately Laurie stocks a sympathy card especially for people who can't get the card they want.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Cross-Cast Role	Both Fry and Laurie frequently wear drag to act out a part.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Damned By a Fool's Praise	In one sketch, Stephen claims that he stole Hugh's brain as a practical joke. Hugh then comes out and praises Noel Edmonds and Kenneth Baker (the Education Secretary at the time).Hugh: Oh, that man is fantastic. He's just what this country needs. He's firm, he's courageous... and his views on education! I mean, they're just so enlightened and sophisticated and enthralling! Well, of course he's an utterly enthralling man.Stephen: (to the audience) Well, of course we can see what's happened, but I don't think he has got a clue, has he?
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Department of Redundancy Department	During this sketch that involves a speech on education and discipline:Basically, the simple purpose of education must be to teach children, young people, to not, I repeat not, break into my car. There will be other aspects to education, I'm sure. But the most fundamental principle of decent, civilized behavior, is: Don't. Break into. My car.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Disappeared Dad	Played for Laughs in one sketch. The duo play two very dense, inept detectives who break into the wrong house looking for a man. After confronting the woman who lives there they demand to see her husband, but she's not married. It transpires the only male there is her infant son (played by Hugh Laurie's real son). They are comically unable to grasp the idea that you can have a child without a husband, while the woman explains the father was "a sailor", and apparently is not around.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Double Entendre	Or just smut.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Dr. Psych Patient	One sketch had two men in a psychiatrist's office, each of whom claims he is the psychiatrist and the other is his patient, trying to talk each other out of their supposed delusion. At the end, it's revealed that both of them are psych patients — the real psychiatrist hasn't arrived yet.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Driver of a Black Cab	
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Drop the Cow	A method used a few times was for the characters to segue into Who Writes This Crap!?, for example accusing each other of having no idea how to properly end the sketch.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Duel to the Death	Except that when their intermediary offers the choice of "sword or pistol", what he meant is that the second man will get the weapon not chosen—so Hugh has a pointy metal stick while Stephen gets a firearm. After trying to work out a way to make it fair, they settle on something they do have two of and are left to try and kill each other with the intermediary's two handkerchiefs, until they realize he doesn't have anything left to signal with.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Eagleland	
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Excuse Question	Parodied.Who was the first man to run the four-minute mile? Was it: A) the Battle of Crecy; B) Moonraker, or C) the athlete and fast record-breaking fast miler Sir Roger "Four-Minute" Bannister, the famous runner?

A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Felony Misdemeanor	"I've written a savage, angry song about jars that get separated from their lids."
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Flair Bartending	In the concluding cocktail scenes of series 3 and 4 (see Gargle Blaster below), Stephen dances, gyrates, and twirls arhythmically as he prepares whatever drink (or not-drink) he or the guests have chosen. His performances get more and more absurd, occasionally resulting in a spill, stuffing the shaker down his trousers and hopping around, or on one occasion swinging it like a yo-yo.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Flynning	In the Tony of Plymouth sketch.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Fun with Subtitles	Subtitles pop up in the Strom Translation sketch when all the characters storm off after the misunderstandings. The subtitler suggests watching things on the other BBC channels, pans from side to side to demonstrate how small the set is, ruminates on the nature of rooms, and then zooms in on a random audience member to zoom up his nostrils. The commentary continues even when the sketch resumes and devolves into a brawl.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Gargle Blaster	In seasons 3 and 4, the show would end with a cocktail being selected and mixed. These started with relatively reasonable suggestions, such as the Whiskey Thunder, involving whiskey, angostura bitters, lemon juice, a pint of oh-so-fresh dairy cream, two olives, and a peanut.note This would in fact be pretty disgusting: the whisky would be heavily diluted by all that cream, which in turn would be curdled by the lemon juice, so you'd end up with a salty, bitter, mildly alcoholic mix of curds and whey. Hugh grimaces visibly when he takes a sip. They then became increasingly absurd, culminating at the end of season 4 with the Modern Britain, which takes Stephen over a minute and a half to describe while the Union Jack is lowered behind him.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	The Ghost	Mr. Dalliard, and Valerie from the Tony & Control sketches. Marjorie is almost The Ghost, but does make one appearance.

A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Gratuitous Foreign Language	
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Halfway Plot Switch	The interview with the schoolmaster who creates a "religious Esperanto" starts with the interviewer sickened by political correctness. And then the schoolmaster talks about how yesterday they had to burn one of the students as a heretic.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Have a Gay Old Time	
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Hidden Depths	At the end of the final episode, guest Robert Daws (one of Hugh and Stephen's costars on Jeeves and Wooster) pulls out a trumpet and plays the "Last Post" call as the Union Jack is lowered and folded up, then plays the solo that Hugh normally does with his mouth.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Hilarious Outtakes	Parodied.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Hurricane of Puns	There is some truly groan-worthy wordplay ("The boy lives with his mother because I emptied a bowl of trifle over her; she got custardy") if you'll pardon the pun... what pun? Wasn't there one? Sorry.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Hypocritical Humor	In the third and fourth series, Hugh tries to add his words to Stephen's send-off only to be insulted into silence. On the one occasion Hugh tries to tell Stephen to just shut up already, he receives a rather menacing Death Glare in reply.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	IKEA Erotica	A fourth-series sketch has Stephen narrating an "improve your lovemaking" cassette. First off, it's Stephen Fry at his mildest, and secondly, the lovers take the instructions really literally and robotically.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	I'm a Humanitarian	The "Tahitian Kitchen" cooking show sketch, where Fry's Julia Child expy advises the best way to prepare ears, fingers, Welsh toes, and footballers' testicles.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Insane Troll Logic	One sketch has an attorney trying to discredit a witness in court on the grounds that she's a lesbian. The "evidence" he uses for that is just more insane troll logic—she sometimes walks by a store that sells Gertrude Stein books, she was going home from a parish council meeting and everyone knows "parish council" is an anagram for "lispian crouch," etc.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Inherently Funny Words	"A model?" from the Airfix model shop sketch.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	It's a Wonderful Plot	A media mogul (a clear Anonymous Ringer for Rupert Murdoch) gets this treatment. It turns out that if he had never lived, the world would be a much better place where everyone would be cultured and well-educated, and live in peace and harmony since he wasn't able to create his media empire which would profiteer heavily on creating divisions in society through the glorification of violence and spreading bigoted discourses against minorities. This makes him decide to turn his life around — because the peaceful world is ripe to be exploited by manipulative media. At this point, his guardian angel, realizing he's a lost cause who will never improve, pushes him off the bridge, then calls him a twat.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Just Like Robin Hood	Tony of Plymouth, who heckles politicians for bleeding the poor people of England while disguised under a lightweight traveling hat. Of course, he freely admits that you could just write your MP.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Kill It with Fire	A pair of monks soundly denounce and prepare to immolate an object they claim is an instrument of Satan, with all the gravity and drama you'd expect from medieval clerics, and solemnly prepare the "chasting dish" for the offensive item—a plastic creamer cup whose cap tore and spilled on the bishop's vestments. Then, when one of them tries to open the cup, he spills it all over himself too.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Know-Nothing Know-It-All	Stuart (Laurie) in the "Gordon and Stuart" sketches, who talks as though he's an expert and puts down his dining partners for "ignorance" when they respond with bemusement—meanwhile, Gordon is demonstrating a mild-mannered but much firmer grasp of the topic, to Stuart's embarrassment.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Law Enforcement, Inc.	They had a sketch about this in their very first episode: Welcome to the Private Police Force. It was a humorous take on privatizations then recently conducted by the Thatcher government, as the episode states not only the police but the UK high roads and even the royal family have been privatized. And it implies the police force is owned by Americans.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Lightbulb Joke	Parodied in one of the Vox Pops segments:Laurie: How many cabinet ministers does it take to change a lightbulb? Three. [Beat] Seems rather a lot to me, but there you are.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Literal-Minded	Often, and often combined with the puns.Critic Hugh: Just wasn't your cup of tea.Critic Stephen: No, no. [points] That's my cup of tea.

A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Luke Nounverber	
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	The Maiden Name Debate	Spoofed in a Vox Pop segment where a woman says that of course she took her husband's name when she married... she used to be Mary Patterson, but now she's Neil Patterson.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Malicious Misnaming	In the "Judge Not" sketch, the lawyer at one point calls Mrs. Elliot "Mrs. Toilet".
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Talkative Loon	The shop assistant in the Mr Dalliard sketches (the same one who prefers the word 'Brothels').
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Miss Conception	ry: Mmm. And Michael just sort of... popped up, did he?Laurie: Yes, well of course it's a few years ago now, but I think one day he was... just there.Fry: And at no stage did you and Mrs. Smear engage in any act of sexual intimacy?Laurie: Yes, it's very hard for you to believe, isn't it? It's very hard for you to believe that there are still some of us who can bring a child into this world without recourse to cannabis and government handouts!Fry: Now, I haven't raised this subject with you before, Rufus, but, erm... have you ever wondered how you came to be born?Laurie: Well, I just sort of assumed, pater, you know, that one day you put your penis inside Mama's vagina and inseminated her ovaries.Fry: Yes, that is what we told you, isn't it...
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Mistaken for Toilet	One Vox Pop features a woman played by Fry sticking her head out from behind the curtain of a photobooth and exclaiming "Excuse me, can't seem to find the flush."
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Mixed Metaphor	
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Moonwalk Dance	Fry plays Michael Jackson (without any costume or accent or mannerism to actually mimic him) and after a brief interview, he performs a song "Move It On Out Girl". He gets on a treadmill and walks on the spot. It's surprisingly accurate to the actual moonwalk.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Moral Guardians	A man comes to complain to his son's school about his son being taught about sex in biology. It quickly becomes clear the dad has no idea how children are really conceived.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Mundane Made Awesome	
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Murder Simulators	One sketch involves the conclusion that, since people are mimicking Stephen punching Hugh (by punching Hugh themselves) it would be a good idea for Stephen to give Hugh money on screen. Turns into an Overly Long Gag.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Never Bring a Knife to a Gun Fight	"The Duel" sketch. Hugh's character is given the choice of weapons: sword or pistol. He chooses sword, so the referee hands him the sword— then hands Stephen's character the pistol. Hugh protests that this isn't what he meant, then silliness ensues as they try to figure out a way to make the fight fair since those are the only weapons they have.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Never Say That Again	The "annoying guy at the vet" sketch.Fry: ...and I make myself a cheese and tommy-toe toastie.Laurie: A what? A cheese and what?Fry: Tommy-toe! Tommy-toe! Tommy-toe!Laurie: TOMATO.Fry: Tommy-toe! Tommy-t—Laurie: Don't say it again!
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	No Fourth Wall	Fry and Laurie will sometimes break character during sketches to comment on the scene or address the audience. Sometimes the sketch is interrupted by someone in the audience, like the man (played by Benjamin Whitrow) who claims that they've plagiarized his sketches.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	No Longer with Us	On learning that Charlotte Bronte is dead, "I can hardly say I'm surprised. Where can I get in touch with her?"
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Noodle Implements	The interviews between sketches abuse this:[given a line to read] I can't read that, I'm a Methodist.Hugh: During the course of the sketch, Stephen hits me several times with a golf club.Stephen: Which, ordinarily, in the course of events, wouldn't matter, but I do it very sexily. [...] And the sketch ends with us going to bed together.(Beat)Hugh: Violently.Stephen: Very violently.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Not Even Bothering with the Accent	Played with in the Michael Jackson sketch. Although he is a skilled mimic, Stephen Fry decided to play "Michael Jackson" in his own accent... and indeed his own clothes with not a single attempt at impersonation... with hilarious results.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Not So Above It All	The politician forced to endure the heckles of a punter yelling that he's trying to rob the poor to line his own bathroom with venison and fine treats initially reacts with mild bemusement... until he learns he's facing Tony of Plymouth, a Just Like Robin Hood do-gooder, at which point he turns into a sneering matinee villain.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Oddly Specific Greeting Card	One sketch features a man trying to buy a get-well card for his wife, only to discover that all the cards in the shop come with specific details about who the card is from, who is receiving it and what is wrong with them. (He buys one card for a grandmother with a hernia "on the off-chance", despite the fact that not only would he have to change his name for it to be useful, his grandmother would have to come back to life.) The assistant eventually finds him a card that matches his case precisely... except it's supposed to come from a Frederick, and his name is Alfred. She ends up giving him an oddly specific card expressing sympathy for his situation.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	One Dialogue, Two Conversations	In "My Dear Boy", Nigel the geeky aeroplane enthusiast answers "Simbold Cleobury's" advert for 'models' (which had indeed been placed in an Airfix enthusiast magazine). Simbold grows more excited and lascivious over Nigel's description of owning a "camel" and starting on modeling at age four and getting covered in glue, and then asks for a photo of his "jumbo" only to be handed a picture of a jet. And Nigel realizes his mistake and takes out another photo, after which he cheerfully agrees to be painted nude.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Our Slogan Is Terrible	"Tidyman's Carpets: The deep shag that really satisfies."
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Overly Long Gag	"I was standing here, and this guy came 'round the corner..."
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Overly Narrow Superlative	The poetry sketch. Laurie offers a bit of poetry, Stephen wonders if they're aimed for one of these."So that might suit, say, a young couple just about to start out in the catering business in the North Wales area?"
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Overt Rendezvous	In the unaired sketch "Spies Five", Tony and Control meet on a park bench because there's a mole in their department.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Parody	
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Page Three Stunna	Referenced in two sketches.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Painful Rhyme	The entire joke behind Hugh's song Mystery.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Patriotic Fervor	Frequently mocked. There are the cricket commentators who have a positive Englandgasm over the thought of Garboldisham and strawberries with cream, librarians who cut out entire books until it's left with a bare sentence about how England is great, deriding people for acting un-English... it culminates in the final episode's cocktail, "A Modern Britain", where Stephen adds low-calorie sweetener and "diluted good values" to Jersey cream, Islay malt whiskey etc and then sobbing "IT'S RUINED! BRITAIN IS RUINED!" as he mixes.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Pelvic Thrust	Fry playing Michael Jackson performs a song "Move It On Out Girl". He does Micheal Jackson's signature "grab-crotch-pelvic-thrust".
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Perfectly Cromulent Word	The "Judge Not" sketch coins the synonyms "lesbite" for lesbian (n.) and "lesboid," "lesbotic" and "lesbicious" for lesbian (adj.).
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Perfume Commercial	Parodied in the fourth-series opening credits ("Pretension, by Fry and Laurie").
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Phony Psychic	One sketch features a man who claims to bend spoons using the amazing power of... his hands. He is quite offended when called on this.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Pluralses	In the Shoe Shop sketch. "I dislike the word 'brothel', Mr. Jowett. I prefer the word 'brothels'. Yes, this is a brothels."
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Pocket Protector	Parodied in one sketch, where Stephen Fry shows the undamaged cigarette case his grandfather carried into battle in World War I.Stephen: He used to keep his cigarette case here in the breast pocket of field tunic or "battle blouse." Now, one day, Grandfather had to go over the top, out of the trenches, into action... and he was shot by a German sniper clear through the temple. Now if Grandfather had worn his cigarette case here (holds case to temple) it would have an unpleasant dent in it and I'd be alive today.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Portmanteau	In the first episode of series 2, Stephen mentioned weight-loss via Dancersise; which rather ingeniously coupled the word "dance" to the word "circumcise".
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Precision F-Strike	At the end of the "fusking clothprunker" sketch mentioned below.Judge: And what did you say to that?Hugh: I told him to mind his [beep]ing language, m'lud.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Privately Owned Society	Portrayed and Played for Laughs in the sketch "The Privatization of the Police Force". They won't do anything about your stolen car unless you purchase a plan.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Product Placement	Spoofed with the episode sponsored by "Tidyman's Carpets".
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Protest Song	'All we gotta to do is ... (mumblemumble)' Hugh notably reprised this when he hosted Saturday Night Live.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Punchline	Frequently avoided. Sometimes Fry or Laurie will end the sketch by complaining that it's gone on too long or killed the joke.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Re-Release Soundtrack	
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Record Needle Scratch	Whenever Hugh and Stephen introduced a guest at the start of an episode in Series 4, the background music would abruptly cut off in this fashion after a few seconds.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Rhetorical Question Blunder	
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Running Gag	The woman who left her iron on.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Sesquipedalian Loquaciousness	One of the best. See an example.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Shaped Like Itself	
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Sickeningly Sweet	The awful dog owner in the vet sketch is disgustingly twee in all his speech patterns (he's the tommy-toe guy). When Hugh's character tries to shut up his inane prattle by saying he's there to have his cat put down due to liver cancer, Stephen only takes a beat before baby-talking to the cat about cancie-wancie. No wonder his dog is there to have him put down.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Sketch Comedy	
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Smarmy Host	Frequently mocked, including various real-life targets such as Noel Edmonds.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Soap Within a Show	The suspiciously familiar Australian soap opera. While it starts as a standard parody of daytime soaps with bad acting, overwrought plots and confusing relationships between the numerous characters, it quickly evolves into something downright surreal.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Sophisticated as Hell	
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Spy Speak	
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Stalker with a Crush	Hugh Laurie plays one of these in the Steffi Graf song.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Stiff Upper Lip	this is the other element of the "Tony and Control" sketches, as both characters are utterly unflappable, even when, for instance, Control announces he's actually a Soviet agent or when he falls out a window
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Straw Critic	The show with the two TV critics has them sprawling further and further down in their chairs, speaking in whining nasal voices and increasingly pretentious language to criticize the previous sketch. By the end they've slid onto the floor and are complaining about that, as well as themselves. (Also an Author Tract, since Fry and Laurie aren't fond of caustic critics.)
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Strongly Worded Letter	
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Stylistic Suck	Played for laughs in the "hedge sketch". Stephen, playing a shop attendant, introduces it in a very formal way. Hugh plays a customer who wants to buy a hedge. He walks up to Stephen and says "Hello, I'd like to buy a hedge, please," and Stephen replies with what should have been the opening line, "Good morning, sir, how can I help you?" They go on like this with the lines persistently in the wrong order, until they both realise that they've blundered and the sketch grinds to a halt. So they start again, this time with the lines in the right order, until Stephen asks, "A hedge? Certainly, sir, what sort of hedge would you like?" and Hugh replies with what should have been Stephen's next line, "Well, we have three sorts, sir: we have the Royal, the Imperial and the Standard hedge." As he does so, he and Stephen realise that Hugh's now saying Stephen's lines. Stephen doggedly goes on saying Hugh's lines, and they physically swap places, which works sort of okay until Hugh rings down to the stockroom to see if they have the right hedge in stock, and when Stephen, playing the stockroom employee, answers "We've got one left," Hugh says (as the customer) "Right, I'll take it then." They swap places again, and Stephen (once again playing the shop attendant) tells Hugh that they've got one left. Hugh replies "Cash, if you don't mind," and Stephen automatically asks him how he would like to pay, before they both realise that once again, they've got the lines in the wrong order. So they start the sketch all over again and play it immense speed without making a mistake, only to get to the end—and realise that there's no punchline. A comically awkward silence ensues.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Sucks at Dancing	Stephen's attempts to move to a rhythm are truly painful to behold. Just look at the "Dancercise" sketch.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Suicide as Comedy	A depressed guy in the vox pop segment says he once tried to kill himself. Locked himself in the garage, started the car. Turns out it had a catalytic converter and he came out after seven hours with a slight headache.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Suicide Is Shameful	One guy in the vox pop segment says he has been depressed for 14 years and claims his wife says he should kill himself, but according to him, it's a coward's way out.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Surreal Humor	Part of the humor are the bizarre, not-quite-right words or elements that have little to do with the actual sketch, e.g., a man eating cornflakes with a knife and fork, or Tony of Plymouth decrying a politician for lining his bathroom with venison and other fine delicacies.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Table Space	"Pass The Marmalade!" ("Arse the Parlor Maid?") sketch. The table extends from one room to the other; the wife has to walk through a door to get the marmalade herself.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	The Talk	
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Take That!	Take that, Margaret Thatcher, John Major, Rupert Murdoch, Moral Guardians, estate agents, Eagleland, yuppie culture, critics, psychics, Top Gear (UK), and Noel Edmonds!
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	The End... Or Is It?	
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Toilet Humor	As if the sight of Stephen Fry hooked up to a never-leave-the-couch device called "Comfi-Pee" wasn't bad enough, the commercial immediately goes on to herald the new Comfi-Poo. Two tanks of sewage bubbling away in the living room.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Totally Radical	"The young and hip-trendy."
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Translation: "Yes"	The entire "Strom" sketch is based on variants of this joke.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Two of Your Earth Minutes	"Twenty of your Earth pounds". Yes, Mr. Dalliard's friend again.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Universal Driver's License	Spoofed with the Flying a Light Aeroplane Without Having Had Any Formal Training sketch.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Unusual Euphemism	"Ram it up your pimhole, you fusking clothprunker!"
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Unwitting Pawn	Neddy/Teddy in the "Jack and Neddy" sketches. Poor chap is too earnest and good-natured to realize that his friend with the eyepatch is a dangerous revolutionary and possibly a Nazi. Jack manages to pressure him into bombing a restaurant and later installs him as a puppet Prime Minister. Then stabs him with the Stanley knife that Neddy had so obligingly lent him.
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Verbal Tic	In "Society", where Stephen and Hugh try to get a woman (Anne Reid) to join their society in spite of having no idea what it's for or why it exists, Hugh's character has the tic of constantly talking under Stephen's remarks and slightly rephrasing what he's saying, sometimes as semi-gibberish.Stephen: Now that's a / good idea!Hugh: ... Ah, now, that, yes.Stephen: A society for people who can't / stand here talking all day!Hugh: ... They can't stand here talking all day and all night.Stephen: I mean when you think of the people who ring on your bell.Hugh: ... Knock on your bell, yes.Stephen: Like Jehovah's / Witnesses.Hugh: ... Well there are witnesses to the Jehovah's incident.Stephen: Charity / collectors, estate agents, small boys wanting their ball back.Hugh: ... Charity collectors, estate agents, another group... small boys whose ball's accidentally gone over your fence back...
A Bit Of Fry And Laurie	Vox Pops	One of the classic comedy uses, several times in each episode between sketches. Featured either Fry or Laurie dressed as an easily recognizable British stereotype and saying something dirty ("Well, I'm aroused every morning by a very insistent cock"), satirical ("I was beaten as a child and it didn't do me any harm!" [slaps self]) a play on words ("So I just told him to stuff it!... but he said it had been dead too long"), or just a non-sequitur ("They've got hotter pavements, I know that").
Accused	Clear Their Name	"Alison's Story" is focused on this after Alison gets framed for drug dealing by her abusive husband's cop father, as a means to get him full custody of their kids.
Accused	The Cloud Cuckoo Lander Was Right	Possibly the case with paranoid schizophrenic Stephen at the end of "Stephen's Story",  where it appears that his stepmother really was poisoning his father and brother. However, it's left ambiguous whether this is another of his delusions or not. In "Tina's Story" Stephen's father reappears, suggesting his final conversation with his stepmother was indeed a delusion.
Accused	Driven to Suicide	
Accused	Downer Ending	"Willy's Story", "Frankie's Story" and "Stephen's Story" end with the title characters getting sentences that seem longer than deserved (or for Stephen, he shouldn't really have been convicted at all, given that he's insane).
Accused	Frame-Up	In "Alison's Story" Alison is framed as a drug dealer by her husband and his police captain father so she'll lose custody of their kids.  Thankfully, this is revealed, she's acquitted, and they get arrested.
Accused	Hallucinations	Stephen sees Alastair Campbell telling him from the television screen to kill his stepmother to save his family from what he believes to be her poisoning them.
Accused	Hearing Voices	Stephen almost constantly hears voices whispering as part of his delusions.
Accused	Hollywood Law	In "Frankie's Story", Frankie is a British soldier who served in Afghanistan. Problem is, the crime he's accused of occurred in Afghanistan on a British military base, against a fellow soldier, yet he's put on trial in a civilian court back in the UK. Any crime on a military base, committed by a soldier, against another soldier, would fall under military jurisdiction and be tried by a military court.
Accused	How We Got Here	The form of every episode's plot. Often what the case is about isn't even revealed until late in.
Accused	Insane Equals Violent	Stephen is a paranoid schizophrenic. His delusions lead him to stab his stepmother, believing she killed his mother, his dog, and is trying to do his father and brother in as well. Somewhat justified with his condition, as the belief they're being persecuted is more likely to make the person use violence (which like Stephen they also may honestly believe is self-defense or defense of others).
Accused	Insanity Defense	Discussed in "Stephen's Story". Stephen's attorney wants him to get a psychiatric examination so they can prove he was insane at the time of his crime (he's clearly a schizophrenic). Stephen refuses though, denying he's mentally ill and claiming what happened was justified to defend himself and his family. This doesn't work, and he gets convicted of attempted murder. Granted, Stephen was aware of the possibility of going to jail, but preferred that to a mental hospital as a prison sentence would come with a set release date.
Accused	Justified Criminal	Willy steals out of desperation to pay for his daughter's wedding.
Accused	Karma Houdini	
Accused	Knight Templar Parent	Mo, with her own mother aiding and abetting, pulls out all the stops to keep her son Jake out of jail. In the process she perverts the course of justice, betrays every principle she espouses, repeatedly deceives her best friend Sue  whose own son, Sean, Jake was coerced into killing and even states under oath that  Sean would have done the same in Jake's position. In the end Jake gets the maximum sentence of twelve years, Sue bitterly spurns Mo, and Mo and her mother become pariahs.
Accused	Rape as Drama	
Accused	Sympathetic Murderer	
Accused	Through the Eyes of Madness	Stephen is clearly a paranoid schizophrenic, which makes him think his stepmother killed his mother, the family dog, and is now trying to kill his father and brother as well.  Eventually this leads to him stabbing her in what he believes to be a defense of them and himself. He refuses to admit he's mentally ill though, or allow a psychiatric examination. This means he's convicted and gets six years in prison when most likely he wasn't responsible at all.
Ace Lightning	Artificial Limbs	Random Virus.
Ace Lightning	Author Avatar	Kilobyte - Rick's Avatar
Accused	Vigilante Man	In "Kenny's Story" Kenny and his friends attack the man they believe violated his daughter. The plot shows why this is a very bad idea, however.  The man was innocent, and Kenny's convicted of murder after he dies.
Accused	Wholesome Crossdresser	Simon, in his guise as Tracie. This even gets him acquitted, as he goes into court dressed as Tracie and successfully shows how ridiculous the idea of committing a crime in that outfit would be.
A Chefs Life	Cold Open	Every episode save the Grand Finale employed this.
A Chefs Life	Downer Beginning	You can't get a series premiere for a documentary about a chef more downer than her new restaurant burning down. The rest of the first season, particularly the next episode or so, concentrates on the rebuilding efforts for Chef and the Farmer.
A Chefs Life	Downer Ending	The aforementioned series premiere, "Sweet Corn and Expensive Tea", ends with a fire that all but incinerates the restaurant, leaving Vivian with no idea where to go from there.
A Chefs Life	The Eeyore	Ben Knight, also known as "Benny Bummer" due to how downcast he typically is compared to everyone else.
A Chefs Life	Grand Finale	"The Final Harvest", an hour-long special celebrating the show and the staff of Chef and the Farmer.
Accused 2023	Ambiguous Ending	Several episodes end in manners that makes clear the story isn't over yet for the characters, but what exactly happens after that is left unknown to the viewers due to the overall self-contained nature of the episodes, leaving them as both this trope and other types of endings.

Accused 2023	Genre Anthology	The series is a Courtroom Drama style anthology with each episode, named after a specific character, focusing on the titular character appearing in court and facing unknown charges. What the charges are will be slowly revealed over the course of the episode, as well as if the titular character actually committed the crime and How We Got Here overall, with the occasional Bait-and-Switch or Red Herring in regards to what actually occurred, with the climax of the episode focusing on the verdict and immediate aftermath.

Adam Hills In Gordon Street Tonight	Audience Interaction	The show very much includes the audience, and thrives on putting individuals in embarrassing situations of various degrees. To everyone's amusement. There has even been a marriage proposal.
Adam Hills In Gordon Street Tonight	Deadpan Snarker	Hannah Gadsby, who has said "she is paid to be a smartarse". She has her own corner of the set from where she watches the show and occasionally interjects to great effect. Sometimes she gets involved with the audience antics. (About halfway through season two, Adam made a seemingly snap-decision to have Hannah included in the main stage in the otherwise empty chairs.)
Adam Hills In Gordon Street Tonight	Painful Body Waxing	Host Adam Hills underwent a 'boyzilian' (a male Brazilian waxing) - and had it filmed for the programme - after receiving a gift voucher for the procedure from an audience member as a 'show warming gift' on the first episode. It was hilarious.
Adam Hills In Gordon Street Tonight	Sammy's Glass Eye	alternatively, Adam's (prosthetic) right foot.
Adam Hills In Gordon Street Tonight	This Is Gonna Suck	One audience member has "Naked Tuesdays" where he takes naked photos of himself (and others generally join in) based on iconic photos (think the famous Beatles Abbey Road shot) as part of coping with throat cancer. Adam sets up a photoshoot for him to do multiple iconic photos. At one point there are three of them naked and Adam reveals the last photo - "Raising the Flag on Iwo Gima." The photographer looks at it and says, "Great - but we only have three people." Two of the guys put their hands on the photographer's shoulders and look at him expectantly. The brief glimpse we have of the photographer's face screams this and a bit of Oh, Crap! [1].
Adam Hills In Gordon Street Tonight	William Telling	In one of the "Hannah Has a Go" segments, Hannah had a go at learning archery. To demonstrate what she had learned, she offered to shoot an apple off Adam's head. Adam asked her to shoot an apple of the head of his cut-out to prove she could do it first. She ended up shooting the head off the cut-out.
Ace Lightning	Adults Are Useless	While they're not really "useless" per se, they know nothing about the part-time superhero thing but they're pretty genial and understanding about the social side of things. One really can't blame them for not suspecting their son is saving the world with a fictional character.
Ace Lightning	A.I. Is a Crapshoot	Ace is possessed in one episode, Random Virus has this problem constantly.
Ace Lightning	All Part of the Show	Lord Fear invades Mark's school during a school play (a somewhat uncreative remake of The Phantom of the Opera). Of course, the audience thinks he's just a very convincing actor. Lord Fear relishes the attention, and Mark is the only one who freaks out because he's the only one who knows what's going on.
Ace Lightning	Amusement Park of Doom	In the video game, the Ace Lightning characters fought against Lord Fear and his maniacal minions in the creepy and deserted Carnival of Doom. When they arrive in the real world, they locate a useful equivalent hideout in the Kent Brother's Carnival.
Ace Lightning	Angst	From most of the cast, though it's mainly either typical, teenage angst, understandable concern about discovering you're really a videogame character and your whole world is just a fiction cooked up for schoolkids, or the kind of angst generated when your Split Personality can't decide whether to help people or to kill them. It's also not too heavy given the show's nature as a comedy first.
Ace Lightning	Anvil on Head	Given that one of the villain's henchmen is a giant, mutant Rhino with an actual anvil for a hand, you can imagine this happens quite a lot.
Ace Lightning	Applied Phlebotinum	The Amulet of Zoar, which everyone is after.
Ace Lightning	Apocalyptic Log	Mark regularly exchanges video communications with Pete: communications which usually took a turn for the serious whenever a series was nearing its end and we were due a showdown.
Ace Lightning	Betty and Veronica	Sam and Heather have a mild version of this going throughout series one (afterwards, Samantha is Put on a Bus, Heather doesn't try to renew the relationship, and Kat becomes the Third-Option Love Interest).
Ace Lightning	Big Bad	Early on, Lord Fear. Then Kilobyte, the incredibly overpowered villain of the third season, created by the Master Programmer in order to defeat Ace Lightning, only to have Kilobyte turn on him and decide to banish all humans to the videogame.
Ace Lightning	Big "NO!"	In the finale. Interestingly, it's Mark, when he thinks Ace has been shot turns out it was Lady Illusion in morph.
Ace Lightning	Bittersweet Ending	The second season. The Big Bad and his minions have been defeated and returned to the game, but so has Lady Illusion just as she and Ace have confessed their love.
Ace Lightning	Booby Trap	The villains plant these several times, and the heroes fall right into them.
Ace Lightning	Boss-Arena Idiocy	Several in the PC game. Googler's immune to Ace's attacks, buuuuuut decides to fight him in a room full of huge barrels of TNT that are enough to hurt the crazed clown. Dirty Rat has a force field Ace can't get through, buuuuuut the giant stone cowboy running around the room can. Random Virus is shielded from Ace's attacks too, buuuuuut for some reason Ace's shots can hurt him if they bounce off something first, like the giant shields hanging all over the walls.
Ace Lightning	Brainwashed and Crazy	Ace, after a bite from Googler's puppets (yes, the puppets bite. They are freaky little dudes).
Ace Lightning	Brought Down to Normal	Ace loses his powers in one episode, and gets them back just in time to save Mark's hide.
Ace Lightning	The Bus Came Back	Sam returns for one episode in the final series. Ironically, the only time we ever see an undisguised on screen kiss between those two characters. It's that kinda show.
Ace Lightning	Butt-Monkey	Usually Mark, who, when he's not getting chewed on by Googler's puppets, dumped into bizarre life-or-death situations which no one else knows about, or would believe is real if they did, or going face to face with Lord Fear, then he's having his social life ruined in a variety of unusual manners (such as, for example, Lady Illusion morphing into him and taking his place at school, to his family and friends annoyance and confusion, being bullied by a nasty teacher or dealing with Lord Fear preventing him from getting to a date on time.
Ace Lightning	The Call Knows Where You Live	Fortunately for Mark it's not a very competent call. It is, however, a highly persistent one.
Ace Lightning	Can't Stay Normal	Ace becomes 'human' after losing his powers in one episode -and hates it. Mark is also regularly forced to confront the fact that he's a "hero" now, and heroes have responsibilities that outweigh going to a movie with your girlfriend.
Ace Lightning	The Cape	Ace (like most of the archetype roles in this series, this is somewhat subverted in that he really doesn't fit in the real world).
Ace Lightning	Cast from Hit Points	Lightning Knights flicker from overusing their powers the same way they do from taking too much damage. They also recover from both by absorbing electricity.
Ace Lightning	Character Catchphrase	The Lightning Knights' Motto: 'Do Right and Fear Not'.
Ace Lightning	Chase Scene	This occurs during Mark's driving lesson when Lord Fear decides to pursue the training car in his Doom Cycle. The tutor is not amused by Mark's... ahem, escape attempt.
Ace Lightning	Chaste Hero	Ace doesn't even know how to flirt. It's ultimately a reason he's glad to have been given human emotions, though: he can break out of this and learn how to love.
Ace Lightning	The Chessmaster	The Master Programmer probably thinks it's him, but really, it's Kilobyte, who knows more about the game than anyone realizes and is pulling countless strings to make things go his way.
Ace Lightning	Cliffhanger	One or two of them. Including a minor one in the final episode, damn it.
Ace Lightning	Combat Tentacles	Kilobyte has these. Very creepy combat tentacles. Mostly used for power drainage.
Ace Lightning	Comes Great Responsibility	Mark always eventually comes around to the importance of helping Ace save the world, regardless of how many relationships it screws up or how often he nearly gets killed.
Ace Lightning	Comically Missing the Point	Subverted, Ace thinks that this is what Mark does on a regular basis by putting his homework and girlfriend duties ahead of saving the world. Mark however, is really more in tune with reality than Ace is.
Ace Lightning	Conservation of Ninjutsu	Notable aversion despite being both an adaptation of superheroes and video games. Usually Lord Fear comes by himself along with just one minion like Anvil, Pigface or Googler to do the dirty work, but that seems to be because the back of an ice cream van isn't the most spacious. Whenever multiple villains attack at the same time, it's always treated as a serious threat the heroes have little chance of withstanding.
Ace Lightning	Continuing Is Painful	The Lightning Knights noticeably have it a lot harder when it comes to being defeated than the villains, who will just step out of their Respawn Point after enough time passes for their health to regenerate. If a Lightning Knight's defeated, they're sent back into the world of the game, and their allies still on this side have to find two of the plot coupons and combine them to summon anyone back. Come second series even that doesn't seem to be an option anymore, since they never try to use the pieces of the amulet Mark still has to bring Sparx back like they had before.
Ace Lightning	Cut Short	The second season was angling pretty hard for a sequel despite being only half as long as the first. It didn't work, so we got No Ending.
Ace Lightning	Cybernetics Eat Your Soul	While it's never outright stated that Random Virus's transformation into a cyborg played a part in his good-evil complex, it's certainly implied that the accident that caused him to be rebuilt had something to do with it.
Ace Lightning	Dating Catwoman	Ace Lightning and Lady Illusion, though she really does love him and ends up saving his life in the final episode.
Ace Lightning	Deadpan Snarker	Mark has his moments, being that his usual role in the show is to inject some reality into the hero-villain battles.
Ace Lightning	Death Is Cheap	At least as long as it's a game character. And that doesn't mean it can't be a Tear Jerker anyway.
Ace Lightning	Defeat Means Friendship	Intriguingly done with Random Virus and Ace, where Ace will regularly have to resort to defeating his friend in a fight in order to quell his evil side and bring back his calmer, kinder personality. Random usually reverts back to bad guy status by their next meeting, however.
Ace Lightning	Demoted to Dragon	Season 1's Big Bad Lord Fear was usurped and made the underling of Kilobyte.
Ace Lightning	Disney Death	
Agents Of SHIELD	Mundane Boss, Superhuman Dragon	
Ace Lightning	The Dragon	Oddly, The Dragon in question is Staffhead, a talking (cockney, for that matter), a winged frog sitting on the staff that Lord Fear always carries.
Ace Lightning	Dramatic Thunder	Occurs all the damn time from the first episode: the CGI characters were initially brought to life by a bolt of lightning striking the aerial of the protagonist's house while he was playing their video game.
Ace Lightning	Dreaming of Things to Come	In episode twelve, Nobody's Hero, Mark dreams in exacting detail exactly what is going to happen to him by the end of the episode. This trick occurred only once, but it got a few fans talking, nonetheless... and you won't believe the theories it resulted in... Though actually, you probably would.
Ace Lightning	Enemy Mine	Realizing he hates Kilobyte even more than Ace, Lord Fear teams up with Ace and Mark to retake the carnival in the last episode.
Ace Lightning	The End of the World as We Know It	What will happen if the bad guys obtain all the pieces of the Amulet of Zoar (little thought is given as to how a bunch of computer game characters can really pose a threat to national security, but hey, they can exist and apparently go some damage, so... Mark figures he'd better play it safe. Then Kilobyte shows up, and the characters know that they really HAVE to take it seriously.
Ace Lightning	Everything's Deader with Zombies	Rotgut in Season 2.
Ace Lightning	Evil Genius	Rick Hummel the Master Programmer. Albeit he calls his office his Fortress of Solitude.
Ace Lightning	Evil Overlord	Lord Fear in the first two seasons, Kilobyte in the third, though Lord Fear gained a few competence points after he was ousted.
Ace Lightning	Expy	Mark is based on Peter Parker, at least in terms of his struggles to maintain a normal life.
Ace Lightning	Extra-ore-dinary	Random Virus's abilities include a partial-control over metal objects. Given that he lives in a junkyard, this comes in handy.
Ace Lightning	Face Death with Dignity	Mark, during the episode Search For Sparx when he and Ace have essentially been thrown to the wolves (or rather the giant killer bee), Ace has given up and won't even try to defend himself. Mark is having none of it, grabs the nearest heavy, blunt object, and tries to defend both of them, despite knowing he doesn't have a chance. The threat to him was the only thing which which gets Ace back on his feet.
Ace Lightning	Failure Is the Only Option	Ace and Mark's attempts to reform the Amulet of Zoar first, since it would be a pretty lame way to end the season if the heroes went into the final battle armed with an all-powerful artifact.
Ace Lightning	Fanfic	A surprisingly full section of fanfiction can be located here.
Ace Lightning	Fiery Redhead	parx, whose hot temper and lack of patience often getting her in trouble.
Ace Lightning	Fire and Brimstone Hell	A level known as White Hot Oblivion in the Ace Videogame, in which Googler was imprisoned by Ace (he's notably annoyed by this). The audience never sees it.
Ace Lightning	Fish out of Water	
Ace Lightning	Foe-Tossing Charge	Anvil does this to the good guys regularly throughout the series (and he's a giant mutant humanoid rhino with a literal anvil in place of one hand, just so you know. Ouch).
Ace Lightning	Frankenstein's Monster	Subverted to a degree. The original Frankenstein's monster was a misunderstood creature shunned by the world (as well as his creator). Ace Lightning's Frankenstein's Monster is Kilobyte, a powerful, tattooed villain with tentacles that he used to drain the energy of those he catches. He wasn't so much get shunned by his creator as rebelled against him having discovered his identity as a Videogame Character.
Ace Lightning	A Friend in Need	You can always count on Ace Lightning. Mark may also be annoyed at Ace almost constantly, but he just can't seem to stay out of the game, and usually shows up to help.
Ace Lightning	Friendly Enemy	Random Virus and Ace are said to have been friends before the series began (that's assuming you believe it happened), but due to Random's dodgy programming, he now has a habit of turning evil at inopportune moments.
Ace Lightning	Friendship Moment	When Random isn't trying to kill him, he and Ace have a few of these.
Ace Lightning	The Game Come to Life	Of the video game variety and the whole basis for the show's plot. A well-aimed lightning bolt strikes Mark's satellite dish, surging through his computer and joystick, and bringing the game characters to life. It is later revealed that the Master Programmer created a program that could bring the characters to life for a whole new way for game interactivity.
Ace Lightning	Geek	Chuck Mugel: a geek of the computer-related variety.
Ace Lightning	Genre Blind	The characters from the Ace Lightning videogame have absolutely no idea that the world they knew was nothing more than a popular 3D platformer. As a result, they are regularly surprised and alarmed by obvious traps, and regularly spurt out corny dialogue.
Ace Lightning	The Glasses Gotta Go	When Jessica removes her glasses for the first time at the end of the series dance, she seems instantly more attractive.
Ace Lightning	Good Colors, Evil Colors	
Ace Lightning	Grew Beyond Their Programming	To begin with, all of the game characters are driven by their programmed roles and personalities. Over time, most develop a greater awareness of themselves and the world around them, developing true emotions, consciousness, and relationships. Ace Lightning and Lady Illusion are particular examples. In early episodes, the characters display a sense of self-awareness to their origins, but lose it as they become more humans. Ace is the only character to discover the Tomato in the Mirror that he is from a game.
Ace Lightning	Hero for a Day	Chuck gets temporary superpowers in one episode.
Ace Lightning	Heroic BSoD	Ace has a literal Heroic BSOD when he contracts a virus during a data transfer, completely freezing him solid. It's a kiss from Lady Illusion which snaps him out of it.
Ace Lightning	Heroic Sacrifice	Lady Illusion at the end of series three.
Ace Lightning	Hidden in Plain Sight	During the final boss fight, Mark realizes the Amulet is hidden in Lord Fear's pipe organ.Mark: ...The music. It's been the music all along!
Ace Lightning	Horrible Camping Trip	Episode 22 is this trope. Mark, Chuck, Brett and Simon go camping only to meet up with Wayne and his boastful dad, whilst the villains look for Mark to prevent Ace from giving him a newly found piece of the Amulet.
Ace Lightning	Hostage for MacGuffin	Usually Mark ends up being hostage for an Amulet piece. It's happened to Sparx at least once, too.
A Christmas Carol 2019	"Eureka!" Moment	An old woman, putting gravel out onto the ice, unwittingly gives Scrooge the key to his redemption. He snatches her pouch away, runs toward the icy pond, and empties the gravel out onto the ice, rendering it unusable for skating and saving Tim's life.
Ace Lightning	I Did What I Had to Do	Mark nearly sets himself up for one of these at the end of the first series when faced with the option of either losing the game and allowing Lord Fear to take over the world, or deleting the videogame from his hard drive, which would delete Ace and all the other CGIs along with it. Fortunately he has a Last Minute realization and is spared from making the choice.
Ace Lightning	I Have This Friend	This happens with Mark a few times (who uses it genuinely when he's trying to figure out ways to help Ace without giving away the fact that said friend is actually a superhero who emerged from his videogame.)
Ace Lightning	I Just Want to Be Normal	Mark Hollander throughout most of the series.
Ace Lightning	"I Know You're in There Somewhere" Fight	Ace is mind-controlled during one episode, and Sparx (while being repeatedly attacked by him) tries desperately to remind him that "we're the good guys!"
Ace Lightning	Invincibility Power-Up	The Flame Upgrade in the second season. Like most such items it only lasts for a little bit though.
Ace Lightning	Ironic Echo	ce: At least I didn't break the window.Mark: Forget about the window! Are you alright?
Ace Lightning	I Want You to Meet an Old Friend of Mine	The character of Pete, Mark's best friend before he moved to America, appeared regularly in the introductions of episodes speaking to Mark from England via a videophone. He appeared in person in one episode of the second series while visiting Mark in America (kind of subverted, in that Pete decides it would be better if he didn't meet Ace).
Ace Lightning	Jumped at the Call	Whereas Mark was initially confused and reluctant to play the Saving the World Game, videogame fanatic (and leader of the Ace Lightning Fan Club) Chuck Mugel jumped at it as soon as he realized what was going on.
Ace Lightning	Just Friends	Mark and Sam, after series two (ironically this is the only time you see them kiss but then this is that kind of show.
Ace Lightning	Kick the Morality Pet	Ace accidentally shoots Chuck after Lady Illusion messes with his program giving him access to human emotions.
Ace Lightning	Kissing Discretion Shot	With the humans, (Mark and Kat kiss in silhouette in the final scene of the series) the CGI characters are less disguised about it.
Ace Lightning	The Last Dance	It's quite literally a last dance for Lady Illusion and Ace Lightning during the finale of the first series, when they quietly and calmly finish the dance that they began several episodes earlier, before she vanishes back into the game.
Ace Lightning	Left Hanging	The second series was baiting pretty heavily for continuation note  Kilobyte's trapped in the game but vows to come back and get revenge, Lady Illusion's snatched away just as she and Ace officially declare their love, Lord Fear and Mr. Cheseborough are on the run , only to end up canceled.
Ace Lightning	The Lifestream	Called The Datastream, this is the swirling purple/blue energy portal that brings the CGI characters to earth from within Mark's game. The portal can be opened by putting together pieces of the Amulet of Zoar.
Ace Lightning	Lightning Can Do Anything	Including bring the characters of a videogame to life, apparently...
Ace Lightning	MacGuffin	The Amulet of Zoar, which is scattered in pieces throughout the carnival and must be completely reassembled in order to win the "game".
Ace Lightning	Mad Scientist Laboratory	Well, angry scientist's computer lab, really.
Ace Lightning	Magical Computer	Tonnes of them, mostly courtesy of Chuck.
Ace Lightning	Magitek	The characters claim that the Amulet of Zoar is magically fuelled, but since they're actually characters who came from inside a videogame.
Ace Lightning	The Man Behind the Man	The Master Programmer behind Kilobyte. Or Kilobyte behind the Master Programmer, depends which episode you're watching.
Ace Lightning	The Masquerade Will Kill Your Dating Life	Mark has a tendency to lose girlfriends this way as he often ends up standing them up or leaving dates to go help Ace fix whatever is going wrong this week. One of them is okay now. The other is still rather bitter.
Ace Lightning	Mid-Season Upgrade	Basically Sparx showing up to help fight in the first season. In the second, that coupled with upgrading the Lightning Knights to have new powers to fight the stronger new villain.
Ace Lightning	Monster Clown	Jesters count, right? 'Cause then Googler qualifies.
Ace Lightning	Mystery Meat	Whatever Mrs Kutcher the Cafeteria Lady is serving this week (Chuck's her favorite for actually liking the goop she serves up in the first place, and gets special treatment.)Ms Kutcher: If I told you what was in it, you wouldn't eat it.
Ace Lightning	Names to Run Away from Really Fast	Lord Fear? Felicity Fury? Anvil? Dirty Rat?
Ace Lightning	Normally, I Would Be Dead Now	Chuck gets hit by Ace's lightning bolts twice. The first time gave him superpowers, the second time merely knocks him unconscious for about sixty seconds - not the usual reaction to electrical trauma.
Ace Lightning	Pac-Man Fever	Inevitable to some degree, being written by people who probably didn't play modern video games. Some aspects of the In-Universe game all the characters came from sound iffy to viewers who did (numbered levels were mostly an outdated concept by the time the show was made), and when people are shown "playing" the game it's usually thumping random keys and wiggling joysticks without any regard for what the screen's supposed to be showing.
Ace Lightning	Personal Gain Hurts	Creating Kilobyte just to get revenge on the people who laughed at your genius was a really, really bad move, Master Programmer.
Ace Lightning	Perverse Puppet	Googler's insane venom-spitting, tree-chomping, scary-joke-telling hand puppets Zip and Snip. Not only are they creepy, sentient things while attached to him, but they can detach themselves and seek out their prey. Hitting them is kind of like trying to swat flies.
Ace Lightning	Plot Coupon	In proper video game fashion, the pieces of the Amulet of Zoar, which both sides are trying to collect.
Ace Lightning	Plot Coupon That Does Something	The pieces of the Amulet of Zoar do more than indicate how close to the end of the game everyone's getting. Whenever a new piece is found it allows its holder to join it with the one they already have and summon a new character to join their side.
Ace Lightning	Poor Communication Kills	
Ace Lightning	The Power of Friendship	Seeing Mark in danger and finally coming to understand what a friend is gives Ace the ability to recover his powers after having lost them.
Ace Lightning	The Power of Love	Lady Illusion brings Ace out of a Heroic BSoD by kissing him.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Fan Disservice	Mary strips for Scrooge,  who offers her money to pay for her son's medical care. Though he does not actually touch her, the whole situation is played explicitly like rape and is clearly hugely traumatizing to her.
Ace Lightning	Powers That Be	The Master Programmer Rick Hummel had been watching Mark and his friends actions since the beginning, waiting for Lord Fear to take over so he can command them and rule the world, though he was only introduced in the third season. (He hadn't been doing a very good job until he created Kilobyte because the good guys kept winning).
Ace Lightning	Power Trio	Ace, Random Virus (when he's in the right mood) and Sparx for the Lightning Knights. Mark, Chuck and Sam (later Kat) for the humans respectively.
Ace Lightning	Protectorate	Don't mess with Mark while Ace is around. Just... don't.
Ace Lightning	Red Eyes, Take Warning	How to tell when Random Virus is in bad guy mode. Although the simple fact that he's left the junkyard is usually an indication of that too...
Ace Lightning	Refugee from TV Land	The entire premise of the show.
Ace Lightning	Refusal of the Call	Mark, initially. Sort of for Random Virus, though it depends what mood he's in.
Ace Lightning	Repulsive Ringmaster	Big Bad Lord Fear is the leader of the Carnival of Doom.
Ace Lightning	Reviving Enemy	The villains are often destroyed after a battle, but will reappear from some fixture around the carnival after their health regenerates.
Ace Lightning	Rhino Rampage	Anvil, the rhinoceros-headed Dumb Muscle of the villains.
Ace Lightning	Revenge	Lord Fear's beef with Ace Lightning appears to stem from the fact that Ace crippled him in battle a long time ago. Word of God says there may have been more to it than that.
Ace Lightning	Roger Rabbit Effect	Ace is acknowledged In-universe as looking like a "cartoon man".
Ace Lightning	Running Gag	Ace constantly breaking things in Mark's household, which his parents discover, sooner or later, and blame on "shoddy American construction". (He gets better by the end of the series, though.) Also Sparx going off somewhere after she's been told not to (and usually getting in trouble in the process). Chuck throwing up.
Ace Lightning	Sadistic Choice	Mark, at the end of the series, has the dilemma of choosing whether to allow Lord Fear to take over the world, or deleting the videogame (including Ace, Sparx and Random) from his hard drive, and therefore removing the heroes from existence. (The fact that he even considered it then, and never even thought of it towards the end of the last series, says a lot for his character development.)note  Also, Kilobyte's a character who didn't actually come from his game. If he deleted the game, it might take the other characters away but it would leave Kilobyte still around and with nobody powerful enough to stop him.
Ace Lightning	Sadist Teacher	Mr Chesborough. Though really he's more bitter and cruel (and later crazy) than sadistic.
Ace Lightning	Secret-Keeper	Chuck is Mark's Secret Keeper in the third season, as is Ashley Hollander throughout most of the series.
Ace Lightning	She Cleans Up Nicely	Jessica, at the end of series one.
Ace Lightning	Shoot the Dog	Mark nearly has to at the end of series one when, anticipating the game being lost and the world being doomed, he nearly deletes the file of the Ace Lightning videogame: which would destroy all the bad guys, but take all the good guys with them. Fortunately he has a last minute breakthrough. In later series Mark chooses to help Ace and the other Lightning Knights to do things the Hard Way without even considering deletion.
Ace Lightning	Shout-Out	Possibly to Masters of the Universe, since Ace Lightning revolves around the Amulet of Zoar, a mystical item that can give multiversal powers to the user, and is sought after by a skeletal lich who hates the muscular, blonde protagonist...
Ace Lightning	Show Within a Show	The game all the heroes and villains come from. A real-life Ace Lightning game came out between the two series meant to be the one in the show itself. There are a couple things in the show it actually provides context for, like Ace having an unreasoning hatred of garden gnomes (One level is full of killer garden gnomes as enemies). However there are things that don't gel with the game's portrayal in the show (An especially big one is Sparx doesn't appear in the game at all. She's mentioned in the introduction and waves goodbye to the player with Ace and Random under the end credits, but that's it).
Ace Lightning	Sidekick	Sparx and Mark, both to Ace. (Later on Chuck, too.)
Ace Lightning	The So-Called Coward	Mark's Dad is shown up on a camping trip by another arrogant father who boasts about his toughness. When the villains attack Mark's Dad fights them and directs the teenager campers how to defend themselves. The other dad ran away.
Ace Lightning	Sorting Algorithm of Evil	Mentioned sometimes in the first season, that the villains are gradually getting more powerful (somehow) to reflect how video games get more difficult the closer you get to the end. Done more blatantly with the introduction of Kilobyte, who by himself is an unfairly powerful new boss enemy, but can also power up the existing villains.
Ace Lightning	Split Personality	Random Virus, who flip-flops between being good and evil.
Ace Lightning	Sword Fight	Only one character has a sword, but since it fires lightning, it makes for some pretty spectacular fight scenes anyway.
Ace Lightning	Supporting Protagonist	Mark is the protagonist of the series while Ace Lightning is the hero.
Ace Lightning	Suspiciously Specific Denial	We're a family friendly carnival, we don't have any aliens or mutants here, never have never will!"
Ace Lightning	Sword Sparks	Sort of. Sparx's sword shoots pink electricity.
Ace Lightning	Take a Third Option	Mark, in the final episode of the second series, when he's left to choose between letting the world be taken over by computer game villains or deleting his new friends from existence, does this instead.
Ace Lightning	Teach Him Anger	Technically, though, Ace already had emotions they were just being moderated and controlled by his program. When Lady Illusion, with a new upgrade from Kilobyte, messes with that program, Ace learns what it's like to have your emotions in control of you, rather than the other way around.
Ace Lightning	10-Minute Retirement	Mark, towards the end of series one in the episode Nobody's Hero.
Ace Lightning	"Test Your Strength" Game	The Carnival of Doom has a "Test Your Strength" game which Anvil hides in.
Ace Lightning	This Is Reality	Mark says this to Ace word for word in one episode. Ace just looks at him funny. Later on Ace becomes aware of the fact that he is just a game character and is understandably upset.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Foregone Conclusion	Scrooge's death is treated as one, where normally it's the final twist.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Freudian Excuse	Scrooge gets one here.  His father was a materialist who was cruel enough to decapitate Ebenezer's pet mouse. Scrooge was also molested by the headmaster of his boarding school, in an arrangement agreed upon by his abusive father.
Ace Lightning	Tin Man	Ace Lightning. He gradually comes to understand his newfound feelings. It isn't that Ace didn't have emotions to begin with so much as that he didn't have access to human ones. His emotions were being kept in check and moderated by his programming. With that program destroyed, his newly uninhibited emotions got the better of him and he became a bit of a bastard for a while. He hates it at first, but grows to accept them and when Lady Illusion dies for him, he realizes he couldn't let go of loving her, no matter how painful it was.
Ace Lightning	Trapped in Another World	The video game characters are stuck in the real world. A few human characters also get trapped in the videogame over the course of the series. Its Kilobyte's ultimate goal to send the entire human population of the world to live inside the game. He clearly hasn't entirely thought this through.
Ace Lightning	The Undead	The main villain of the first two series (and finally once again at the end in a rather awesome fashion), Lord Fear; walking skeleton and the resident Lich. Also Rotgut the zombie cowboy in the second season, who prefers the term "walking dead".
Ace Lightning	Unusual User Interface	Characters access the Sixth Dimension (the videogame world Ace hails from) by putting together pieces of the Amulet of Zoar.
Ace Lightning	Unstoppable Rage	Do not - repeat, not - get on Ace's bad side.
Ace Lightning	Use Their Own Weapon Against Them	In "Unidentified Flying Hero", Sparx is disarmed of her sword in a fight with Googler. His puppets Zip and Zap use the sword to blast her back into the game.
Ace Lightning	Villainous Breakdown	Lord Fear during the final episode of the series (it's rather creepy).
Ace Lightning	Villain Decay	Lord Fear, after the overshadowing arrival of Kilobyte
Ace Lightning	Voluntary Shapeshifting	Lady Illusion is capable of morphing into other beings. And does so regularly.
Ace Lightning	Welcome to the Real World	Ace Lightning and a gang of villains appear in the real world. It takes them a while to get used to this.
Ace Lightning	Wham Episode	"Unidentified Flying Superhero": Sparx's death scene was so utterly unexpected and brutal in the middle of an otherwise lighthearted episode, (not to mention surprisingly handled) that nobody really cared that she would probably be back within a few episodes.
Ace Lightning	What Have I Become?	Ace realizes how dangerous and uncontrollable he has become now that he has human emotions - specifically when he nearly kills Chuck.
Ace Lightning	What the Hell, Hero?	After the part of his program controlling his emotions is screwed with, Ace finds it... a little difficult to keep control. Manifestations of "what the hell, hero?" include explosive anger at Fear, an outright outburst at a very confused Mark, and his accidentally shooting Chuck.
Ace Lightning	Wild Card	Random Virus, a powerful cyborg with a damaged program that causes him to switch between good and evil at Random (pun totally intended) intervals.
Ace Lightning	Woman Scorned	Heather really doesn't appreciate Mark's inability to pay attention to his girlfriends. There were some viewer complaints since she apparently went from Action Girl to petty bitch in the space of a season with no real explanation.
Ace Lightning	You Are Not Alone	Mark to Ace at the end of series two, and a couple of times throughout the rest of the series. The general theme seems to be when the chips are down, help out your friends.
Ace Lightning	You're Insane!	Mark, to Rick Hummel, the Master Programmer. Because he is.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Abusive Parents	Scrooge's father, who beheads his son's pet mouse and gives Scrooge away to be molested by a schoolmaster.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Age Lift	Scrooge and Marley, usually depicted as elderly men, are played by 52-year-old Guy Pearce and 46-year-old Stephen Graham respectively.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Adaptational Angst Upgrade	Scrooge's childhood is made much, much worse in this version.  His father, rather than just being distant and leaving him at boarding school, is aggressively abusive. His worst acts include beheading a pet mouse Scrooge's sister gave him for a Christmas present and arranging for Scrooge to be molested by the headmaster of the boarding school in exchange for waiving tuition fees.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Adaptational Badass	Most characters, for better or worse.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Adaptation Expansion	The series expands many previously unexplored plot points from the novella such as Jacob Marley's path through the afterlife and subsequent "recruitment" as a harbinger for the Spirits, to Scrooge's time at the boarding school, to Mary Cratchit's expanded role in the story.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Adaptational Name Change	Scrooge's sister, while typically named Fan, is named Lottie in this adaptation.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Adaptational Villainy	
A Christmas Carol 2019	Adapted Out	
A Christmas Carol 2019	Ascended Extra	
A Christmas Carol 2019	Cool Big Sis	Lottie Scrooge, who  pulls a gun on Scrooge's schoolmaster when the latter refuses to let him go home for Christmas.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Covers Always Lie	The promotional image depicts Scrooge with the Ghost of Christmas Future in his traditional visage - the Grim Reaper - hovering ominously behind him. In the actual movie, the Ghost of Christmas Future looks nothing like this, instead, he looks like an eerie gothic man with his lips sewn shut.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Darker and Edgier	Extremely so. This version amps up Scrooge's cruelty to a degree that it nears the Moral Event Horizon, gives him a horrendously tragic past, and cuts out almost all of the original story's lighthearted moments.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Deadpan Snarker	Scrooge, as usual. For instance, responding to Bob Cratchit's "Sort of Christmas present, is it?" (when Scrooge lets him use his ink) with "If it were, I would have wrapped it in paper and ribbons in order to artificially increase your anticipation."
A Christmas Carol 2019	Demoted to Extra	
A Christmas Carol 2019	Dropping the Bombshell	After discovering that Scrooge never intended to have sex with her, Mrs. Cratchit curses him in a way that indicates her involvement with Scrooge's haunting.  "I will... and I will say a prayer, that someday, some power of justice will grab you by the throat and drag you to a true, bright mirror that you might see the truth in your reflection and that the truth will be known to the world. I am a woman, and I have the power to summon such spirits... and I fucking will".
A Christmas Carol 2019	The Ending Changes Everything	The ending suggests the ghosts themselves were actually instruments of Mrs. Cratchit's curse towards Scrooge for sexually exploiting her.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Ethnic Magician	Mary is given a Race Lift and is not only aware of the Spirits but heavily implied to have summoned them.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Freudian Excuse Is No Excuse	While The Ghost of Christmas Past is sympathetic to Ebenezer for what he went through, he still tells him that his history of abuse doesn't excuse his abuse towards others.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Horrifying the Horror	The Ghost of Christmas Past is initially confident that he alone can convince Scrooge to repent as he has done for thousands of other sinful souls, but upon seeing for himself the mental gymnastics that Scrooge is willing to leap through to justify even his most heinous actions appear to send the formidable spirit into a Despair Event Horizon, now convinced as Marley was that there is no hope for Scrooge.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Irony	The legend of Icarus is a story for Tiny Tim and Scrooge references it in a final conversation with him, stating Tiny Tim will learn how to fly. Icarus is famous for flying too close to the sun and plunging to his death after the heat melts the adhesive wax on his wings.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Jerkass Has a Point	Scrooge, despite his many, many shortcomings, does make the good point that people should be kind to each other all year round, rather than just on Christmas Day. His other monologues and soliloquies about the more minor hypocrisies and meaningless trivialities brought upon by the holiday are also hard to dispute.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Love Redeems	Subverted;  The Ghost of Christmas Past shows Scrooge the love of his life and explains to him how Scrooge could have redeemed himself or had a better life if he chose to raise a family instead of work for material gain. Scrooge, while clearly touched by the life he could have had, doesn't see it as a compelling reason to change his current course.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Magical Negro	Twice;
A Christmas Carol 2019	Mouth Stitched Shut	As mortals are not supposed to know too much of their future, the Ghost of Christmas Future's mouth is sewn shut.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Moving the Goalposts	Scrooge frequently describes himself as a man of reason, yet when confronted with something that explicitly contradicts the principles he claims to espouse, he comes up with arguments to reframe either the event or his own principles. His tone of voice when he does so suggests even he finds his own arguments unconvincing.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Not His Sled	The entire Ghost of Christmas Future segment plays out very differently to the original book. First, Tiny Tim's death is shown to be caused not by illness but by falling through the icy lake he was skating on that Christmas afternoon. Next, when faced with the corpse on the bed, Scrooge peels the sheet back to see that it is himself. Then, when he sees his grave being treated the same as Marley's, in a quiet moment with his deceased partner he admits that he doesn't want redemption as he doesn't deserve it and that the only thing he wants to change is Tiny Tim's fate (which he gets to do himself by spreading salt on the lake and making sure Tiny Tim goes nowhere near it). Evidently, this is enough for the powers that be as Marley is shown to receive the peace he was promised at the start of the miniseries for getting Scrooge to change.
A Christmas Carol 2019	O.O.C. Is Serious Business	While the Ghost of Christmas Past's efforts clearly rattle him, they don't actually induce much of a change in his outlook or behaviour. The first time he breaks old habits (not noticing and counting tangible, material things in a room, actually expressing a desire to counteract his previous transgressions rather than engage in mental gymnastics to justify them) is when the Ghost of Christmas Present shows him the Cratchits' home.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Pet the Dog	Almost literally. Even at his worst, Scrooge has a soft spot for animals and it's this, plus an act of kindness to two cold horses, that convinces the powers that be that there is some good worth saving in the man.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Pimping the Offspring	As its revealed in this adaptation, whilst he was a boy Ebenezer Scrooge's father worked out a deal with the pedophilic headmaster of his boarding school that he was free to abuse Scrooge in exchange for his father not having to pay his fees to attend the school.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Race Lift	Mrs. Cratchit is played by black actress Vinette Robinson while most adaptations portray her as white.
A Christmas Carol 2019	"The Reason You Suck" Speech	Mary gives a massive one to Scrooge after  he makes her strip to her undergarments to see how far she would go to save her son's life.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Redemption Rejection	Scrooge attempts this near the end, declaring that he doesn't deserve to be redeemed, and refuses to repent for his own sake. However, his earnest wish that he could save Tiny Tim's life (a truly unselfish action) is enough to convince the spirits that he deserves another chance.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Rewatch Bonus	The feminist theme changes the interaction with The Ghost of Christmas Past; when Scrooge's sister saves him from the boarding school by holding the headmaster at gunpoint, it's initially portrayed as if the ghost is showing how much his family actually loved him. With the ending in mind; the scene changes into the ghost shaming him for becoming just as bad as his headmaster for sexually extorting Mrs. Cratchit, despite being in a similar situation when he was a child.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Scarpia Ultimatum	Scrooge's "experiment". He offers to provide money to Mary Cratchit to save Tim's life if she agrees to give up her virtue. He stops her after she's half-undressed, not being interested in actually having sex with anyone, but he is satisfied that she is willing to humiliate herself for the sake of her son.  She was not happy, and indeed his putting her through this ordeal may have been the reason that Scrooge encountered the ghosts in the first place.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Servile Snarker	This version of Bob Cratchit politely, but assertively, points out when Scrooge is doing things that don't make sense, and he engages in some thinly veiled insults about what a dick he is in general. Scrooge tolerates it either due to Cratchit's extreme competence being profitable for him (which he tells Mary when he  blackmails her into ensuring that Bob doesn't leave his employ) or because Scrooge actually enjoys the slight sparring with somebody who can't risk truly challenging him.
A Christmas Carol 2019	There Are No Therapists	Justified since this is set in the Victorian Era; Scrooge has deep-rooted mental scars after being sexually exploited by his father and repeatedly molested by his headmaster. He was so traumatised that he couldn't recognise how his sister rescued him from the boarding school after the death of his father.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Twisted Christmas	Noticing a theme here? This is quite possibly the darkest take on the story, and certainly a leading contender for it.
Ackley Bridge	Gayborhood	Kaneez actually goes to Hebden Bridge to find out more about lesbians after Nas comes out to her.
Ackley Bridge	Gay Guy Seeks Popular Jock	Naveed has a crush on his popular best friend Cory in Series 2.
Ackley Bridge	The Glorious War of Sisterly Rivalry	Half-sisters Kayla and Marina are like this (Kayla is more well-behaved and nerdy whereas Marina is an Alpha Bitch), but there are moments that show they care about each other.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Wants a Prize for Basic Decency	Scrooge believes he's a good person because he chose not to rape Mrs. Cratchit after forcing her to undress, and makes some rather long leaps of logic (in a tone of voice that suggests even he doesn't fully believe in what he's saying) to justify what he did due to the good results of it (her getting the money to save Tiny Tim) and ignoring the utterly pointless pain he inflicted on her. The Ghost of Christmas Past understandably doesn't accept this as Scrooge's epiphany.
A Christmas Carol 2019	Wham Line	After discovering that Scrooge never intended to have sex with her, Mrs. Cratchit curses Scrooge for making her believe she was prostituting herself for Tiny Tim's safety. The phrasing of her curse indicates that the Christmas ghosts aren't actually there to teach Scrooge about greed and goodwill, they are there to punish Scrooge for his sexual misconduct and misanthropic outlook on life.  "I will... and I will say a prayer, that someday, some power of justice will grab you by the throat and drag you to a true, bright mirror that you might see the truth in your reflection and that the truth will be known to the world. I am a woman, and I have the power to summon such spirits... and I fucking will".
A Christmas Carol 2019	What Is This Thing You Call "Love"?	
A Christmas Carol 2019	Women Are Wiser	The women in the series are portrayed as strong, in control, and more powerful than the men, while the men are depicted as cruel, weak, and objectifying (with the exception of Bob Cratchit).
A Christmas Carol 2019	Younger and Hipper	Most of the characters are aged down in this adaptation. Bob Cratchit is notably changed from a humble, dumpy, and submissive middle-aged worker to a younger, handsome, and assertive man with an open attitude against Scrooge.
Action	Accidental Misnaming	Peter constantly forgets Adam's name.
Action	Adam Westing	A lot of celebrities made cameos on this show, including Salma Hayek (who beats up Peter), Sandra Bullock (who beats up Peter), Scott Wolf (sensing a pattern here?)...
Action	Butt-Monkey	Stuart, especially when he complains that Peter is now taking movie advice from his "whore" (Wendy). Peter's response?"She's not my whore, she's my prostitute. You're my whore."
Action	Cluster F-Bomb	Everyone, especially Peter. This is particularly notable as the series was the first network television show to allow such language on air, even bleeped out.
Action	Comic Sutra	endy: Adam, do you know what I used to do?Adam: You were a prostitute.Wendy: Adam, do you know what a two-fingered Mexican oil job is?Adam: No.Wendy: I do. Do you know what a double-knobbed rubber-bottom sex-basket is?Adam: No.Wendy: I own one, Adam. Adam, have you ever had a Dominican face-hat?Adam: No.Wendy: Of course you haven't. Cause I'm one of only six people in the world who knows how to do it, and Adam, when you get to page 80 I will do it to you. I'm even gonna throw in the incredibly difficult reverse ceiling squad, which normally requires a permission slip from a cardiologist.
Action	Cosmic Plaything	The entire series is based around Peter Dragon's fall from grace and his chance to claw his way back to the top of the heap. This trope is explicitly acknowledged and lampshaded when spoiled A-List star Holden Van Dorn makes the mistake of claiming he has Bad Luck in front of Peter...Peter: Hey, hey, hey... bad luck? Let me tell you something - thirty-three years old I had cancer of the mole, that's "bad luck". *to Lonnie* I'm calm! Heart attack at thirty-four is "bad luck". Overdosing the Director while fucking his wife in the hot tub, he's wearing water wings for christ's sakes! That! Is! Just! Sheer! STUPIDITY!!!
Action	Cut Short	The series ends while Beverly Hills Gun Club is still being filmed.
Action	Determinator	Peter, in spades. He may be a cold-hearted amoral coward, but he is bound and determined to get to his place on top no matter what it takes.
Action	Downer Ending	The result of being cancelled before its main arc could be finished.
Action	End-of-Series Awareness	The final handful of episodes include Peter legally dying of a heart attack (time of death: 9:30 on a Thursday night), and Peter saying to an interviewer that a TV series about his life would be a hit if it was in the right timeslot.
Action	Even Evil Has Standards	Peter does have a few stray morals lurking in his heart, though they usually manifest themselves at inopportune moments... like when his drug-addled A-List star accidentally murders the director of his movie.
Action	Eye Take	When Peter realizes what a smarmy agent asking him to cast a "falsely accused former football player" is really doing...Peter: You're pitching me OJ Simpson?!?Agent: Every kid knows his name!Peter: Yeah, every kid knows to stay away from him!'
Action	Gag Penis	Bobby G. He isn't shy about it either, typically whipping it out in front of Peter to end an argument.
Action	Genre Blind	Adam seems completely unaware of the kind of people he's dealing with.
Action	Hooker with a Heart of Gold	Subverted; Wendy's more or less just as misanthropic as everybody else, but she at least has some good qualities.
Action	Implausible Deniability	When confronted with a furious Sandra Bullock, Peter denies he had anything to with releasing a sex tape featuring the two of them. Bullock then points out the DragonFire Films logo on the box, and adds that it's currently the #1 video in Taiwan.
Action	Inexplicably Identical Individuals	When Peter asks Stuart to get the bookish Jewish screenwriter Alan Rifkin to write his film, Stuart mistakenly signs the bookish Jewish screenwriter Adam Rafkin instead. Could also be a lampshading of Racial Face Blindness.
Action	I Should Write a Book About This	Peter states to a tabloid interviewer that if Beverly Hills Gun Club failed, he would have to move to television, and floats an idea about doing a TV series about his film career.
Action	Jerk with a Heart of Jerk	The main protagonist Peter Dragon, who doesn't have a single redeeming quality.
Action	Narrating the Obvious	Invoked in-universe. On the above-mentioned sex tape, Peter keeps using Sandra Bullock's full name all through the act. Why? So the tape's viewers would know it was her.
Action	No Dead Body Poops	Lampshaded and zigzagged! When Titus Scroad drowns in his pool, Uncle Lonnie isn't quite convinced he's dead... until he [Lonnie] manages to spot a suspicious bulge.Lonnie: How do we know he's really dead?Peter: What?Lonnie: When someone dies, they crap themselves and I don't think... never mind. It's stuck underneath.
Action	One-Word Title	As a reference to "Lights, Camera, Action", as the show deals with Hollywood.
Ackley Bridge	Girl Posse	Subverted in that Marina (who is introduced as a mean girl) becomes very close with Fizza, Chloe, Hayley, Rukhsana, and Spud by the end of Series 5, but they are still individual characters and Marina is no longer an Alpha Bitch.
Ackley Bridge	Glasgow	Lila accidentally outed herself to her dad after he caught her kissing her girlfriend outside King Tut’s.
Action	"The Reason You Suck" Speech	Peter delivers a blistering one to a US senator grilling him about the violent content in his movies and asking how he can look his young daughter in the eye:Peter Dragon: I manage. I never voted to subsidize the growing of tobacco, while turning my back on food programs for starving kids. I've never vetoed a gun control bill; all MY guns are fake, Senator. I've never rushed to the defense of Kuwaiti oil fields, while ignoring genocide in Africa, because big oil companies that line your fat pockets aren't concerned with black Africa. Those are all productions of YOUR company Senator, this company right here!
Action	Straight Gay	Stuart and Bobby. And Cole. This is Hollywood, after all.
Action	Sworn Brothers	Inverted. A very drunk Peter declares he and Adam to be this, then stabs both himself and Adam through the hand with a toothpick. Adam's horrified reaction shows the feeling is not mutual.
Action	Take That!	Once it was clear that the show wasn't going to be renewed by FOX, the Creative Team took vicious aim at the Weinstein Brothers with the Rothstein Brothers, portraying them as villainous gluttons who are even more morally bankrupt than Peter.
Action	This Is Wrong on So Many Levels!	Explicitly invoked by an Orthodox Jewish investor when Peter attempts to give him a Beverly Hills Gun Club prayer shawl.
Action	Unsympathetic Comedy Protagonist	Pretty much everybody to some degree, but especially Peter.
Action	Villainous Respect	Peter is disgusted at an agent trying to pitch O.J. Simpson as a client, but after he closes the door on him Peter immediately proclaims he's a really good agent.
A Country Practice	The City vs. the Country	Simon is a newly qualified doctor from the city. All of his family are doctors in impressive places like London and Harvard.
A Country Practice	Escaped Animal Rampage	A Wedding Episode two-parter airing around 1988 had several goats escape from a pick-up truck following a near-miss. Most were recaptured, but one goat provided to be difficult, and a farmer attempts to tranquilize him. He accidently shoots the priest intending to minster the wedding, in the butt. The goat makes it to a local pub and eats the wedding cake before finally being recaptured.
A Country Practice	Potty Emergency	In the episode "Heroes And Villains" Terrance and Rosemary are stuck in an elevator in a hotel for several hours, during which time Rosemary is desperate to relieve herself after having drunk too much champagne. After 4 hours of being stuck, Rosemary decides she can't wait any longer and prepares to relieve herself in the corner of the elevator(something which Terrence remarks she should have done four hours previously). Just as she prepares to do this, the elevator doors open and her and Terrence are confronted by hotel staff and a group of reporters with cameras. They subsequently film Rosemary's dash to the hotel washroom and her accidentally entering the gents washroom by mistake.
A Country Practice	Scout-Out	Little Jessie is an ersatz Brownie/Girl Guide
A Country Practice	Call-Back	The Season 12 episode "Every Move You Make" has a scene with Terence having a birthday celebration at the pub.

Ackley Bridge	Abusive Parents	Kevin Wilson.
Ackley Bridge	Alpha Bitch	Marina in Series 4 and 5. In her first episode, she sets up a website to humiliate her own half-sister just because she was embarrassed at being excreted on by a horse. She later catfishes her own headteacher and just in general acts as if she runs the school. Character Development makes her more of a Lovable Alpha Bitch as Series 5 progresses.
Ackley Bridge	Amicable Exes	Mandy and Steve, despite their divorce, stay on good terms and she reassures him that he will he part of their child's life.
Ackley Bridge	Arranged Marriage	Kaneez was pulled out of school at sixteen to marry Iqbal and emigrated to England with him soon after, so she’s determined that Nas will get the education and opportunities that she missed out on. When she realises that Iqbal is trying to get Nas to agree to a marriage into a rich family in Pakistan, she hits the roof, accusing him of trying to sell his own daughter, the unstated implication being that they'll bail Iqbal out of his financial problems if the marriage goes ahead. Nas also shoots the idea down right out the gate. Iqbal insists that he would never force Nas to do anything she didn’t want to do, but instead of just letting the issue drop, he keeps trying to sell Nas on the idea. He wears her down enough that she yields and agrees in a vulnerable moment after Lila breaks up with her to at least consider it. Kaneez isn’t happy but tries to be supportive until Nas breaks down and admits that she can’t go through with it because she’s gay.
Ackley Bridge	Ascended Extra	Cory appears in Series 1, but not to do much. He is one of the most significant characters in Series 2 and 3.
Ackley Bridge	Bratty Teenage Daughter	Marina is usually ungrateful and shallow, constantly arguing with her mother Jules.
Ackley Bridge	Break the Haughty	Happens to Alya after her father goes bankrupt.
Ackley Bridge	Bumbling Dad	Iqbal is a well-meaning but inept businessman who’s been absent for much of his kids’ day-to-day lives, leaving Kaneez to pick up the slack.

Ackley Bridge	Characterization Marches On	Jordan's racism is very obvious in the first episode but this is soon ignored entirely and nonexistent by Series 2. History repeats in Series 5; Kyle makes racist remarks in some of his first few scenes but this never comes up again.
Ackley Bridge	Coming-Out Story	Naveed's sexuality is discovered by his homophobic mother in Series 2 Episode 10. By the end of the episode, he publicly comes out to everyone he knows at one of his comedy gigs.
Ackley Bridge	Delinquents	Jordan in Series 1-2 and Kyle in Series 5.
Ackley Bridge	Disappeared Dad	Missy and Hayley live with their Nana due to their mother's substance abuse (although they somewhat have a relationship with her). Their dad is completely absent.
Ackley Bridge	Drama Club	Multiple characters, notably Cory and Naveed, are in the drama club rehearsing for a School Play in Series 2.
Ackley Bridge	Elite School Means Elite Brain	Nas leaves Ackley Bridge to attend Oxford at the end of Series 3.
Ackley Bridge	Freeze-Frame Bonus	In Series 5 Episode 9, a letter from Nas wishing her mother and brother luck for their exams is the focus of one shot, but one could miss what it says if not paying attention.
Ackley Bridge	Held Back in School	Missy is repeating her GCSE year as a result of turmoil at home caused by her mother Simone’s heroin addiction.
Ackley Bridge	High-School Dance	There is one in the Series 5 finale, which is also the series finale.
Ackley Bridge	Imagine Spot	Missy briefly imagines Nana Booth appearing in class with her and Hayley to chat about food after her death.
Ackley Bridge	Implied Rape	In Series 5 Episode 7, Marina and a boy she barely knows, Josh, go somewhere private during a party. Although she somewhat fancies him, he is extremely touchy and she appears to just freeze up as he embraces her. The scene cuts to Marina traumatically leaving the party. The next episode focuses on the aftermath, essentially confirming he raped her but the word is never said. Overlaps with Rape as Drama and Rape Discretion Shot.
Ackley Bridge	Inner City School	Inverted. Ackley Bridge is a former mill town in a valley somewhere in the vicinity of Leeds and Bradford, but the rural landscape at the edges of the town is pretty much the only differentiating factor from any given inner-city neighbourhood, and the school has to contend with many of the same issues you might expect to see in a deprived urban area such as racial tensions and students dealing with abuse and/or addiction in their home lives.
Ackley Bridge	Intimate Hair Brushing	Kaneez has her hair restyled and talks about how she and her sisters would comb each other's hair back in Pakistan. Her daughter then brushes her hair for her.
Ackley Bridge	Intra-Scholastic Rivalry	This is how Ackley Bridge is portrayed at the beginning of the series, shortly after the merging of two schools; the white students and Muslim students do not integrate well at first.
Ackley Bridge	Jerkass	Alya Nawaz, who acts as a mean girl and makes fun of other people's financial situations.
Ackley Bridge	Jerkass Has a Point	Jordan might be a self-confessed racist and all-round inflammatory dipshit, but he makes a good point about how successful integration is unlikely to alleviate the real reason the town is going down the drain:”We all know Ackley Bridge is nothing but a left-for-dead town with foodbanks, smackheads and pramfaces. It doesn’t matter if you’re White or Asian. There’s no jobs for us. We’re all going nowhere.”
Ackley Bridge	Killed Off for Real	Mr Qureshi is stabbed to death in Series 2 and Missy Booth is hit by a car in Series 3.
Ackley Bridge	Living Prop	The show often reuses extras to make the school setting more realistic; some extra characters are named and are clearly seen interacting with main characters, but are essentially just living props and have no plot significance. Furthermore, Rukhsana and Spud appear very often in Series 5 but barely have lines and have no storylines revolving around them.
Ackley Bridge	Mistaken for Gay	In Series 1, Riz gives Cory his sister Alya's phone number… except he doesn't, and gives him his number instead. When Cory finds out Riz has been getting his flirty texts meant for Alya, Cory's first thought is that Riz is gay. Riz admits it was so he could get inspiration on how to talk to girls.
Ackley Bridge	My Local	Much like Teachers, the school observes the custom of staff and pupils going to separate pubs, something Chloe only realises when Hayley and Raz dupe her into going to the teachers’ pub, The Two Moons.
Ackley Bridge	Never My Fault	Sadiq’s response to his infidelity being made public, an attitude that absolutely infuriates both his children.
Ackley Bridge	No Dress Code	Downplayed. There is clearly a school uniform, but often main characters have some sort of casual jacket or accessory that makes them stand out (such as Missy's iconic jacket or Johnny's denim jacket).
Ackley Bridge	Not Actually His Child	For most of Series 1, everyone believes that Jordan is the father of Candice's baby, before The Reveal via DNA test that Jordan's brother Cory is actually the father.
Ackley Bridge	Obnoxious In-Laws	Kaneez is despised by Rashid's mother Zainab in Series 4.
Ackley Bridge	Only Known by Their Nickname	Kacey "Spud" Gartside.
Ackley Bridge	Out of Focus	Chloe Voyle, Razia Paracha and Hayley Booth have all received less focus since Series 1. Ultimately subverted with Chloe when she has more of a significant role in Series 5.
Ackley Bridge	Parental Substitute	Missy and Hayley’s nana moved in with them after Simone lost custody. Owing to her poor physical health, she isn’t able to do much actual parenting, but instead acts as a buffer between the girls and Social Services so that Missy can continue to look after Hayley. As the series goes on, it becomes clearer that Emma and Kaneez are the people Missy turns to when she needs help.
Ackley Bridge	The Place	
Ackley Bridge	Pop-Up Texting	
Ackley Bridge	Put on a Bus	Major characters come and go what feels like all the time - sometimes mid-series. Significant examples include:
Ackley Bridge	Racist Grandma	Sue Carp fills this role in the teaching faculty.
Ackley Bridge	Retool	In Series 4, the episode runtime was shortened and several new characters joined to replace the many who left at the end of the previous series. The timeslot was also moved to 6pm in order to appeal to a younger audience.
Ackley Bridge	Rugby Is Slaughter	Downplayed. Riz has a spinal injury in Series 2 during a game, and Rukhsana gets a minor ankle injury in Series 5.
Ackley Bridge	School Sport Uniform	The sport uniform is orange and purple.
Ackley Bridge	Secret Other Family	Iqbal is discovered to have another partner and two children in Bradford. He visits them under the guise of "working in Pakistan".
Ackley Bridge	Settled for Gay	This is what Nas and Naveen's original plan was; a gay and a lesbian marrying to hide their true sexualities from their potentially unaccepting families.
Ackley Bridge	Starving Student	A recurring theme is the students coming from poor backgrounds; especially Cory and Jordan. Johnny and Queenie are also struggling in Series 5.
Ackley Bridge	Teacher/Parent Romance	Headteacher Martin Evershed enters a relationship with Kayla and Marina's mother Jules. Technically this also qualifies for Kaneez (mother of protagonist Nas) and Rashid, but in that case they are also both Ackley Bridge staff.
Ackley Bridge	Teen Pregnancy	Candice Murgatroyd had one of these.
Ackley Bridge	Those Two Guys	Rukhsana and Spud are rarely seen apart.
Ackley Bridge	Troubled Teen	Pretty much all of the main teen character seem this way (abusive parents, poverty, delinquents etc.)
Ackley Bridge	Two-Teacher School	The faculty seems absurdly small for a secondary school that is a merger of two other schools.
A Crime To Remember	The '40s	The "Gentleman Killer" murder and rapes; the "Lipstick Killer".
Adam Adamant Lives	Sealed Good in a Can	The Face sealed Adam away in the ice as a final and eternal punishment of living death for meddling in his plans.

Leroy Adams, the kidnapping and murder of Stephanie Bryan, kidnapping and murder of Bobby Greenlease, the Sam and Marilyn Sheppard case, the Starkweather murder spree, the murder of the Clutter Family, and the LAPD rape cases.

A Crime To Remember	The '70s	The murder of Roseann Quinn, John Linley Frazier's murder spree, the Franklin Bradshaw murder, and the "Cain and Abel" murders all occurred in this decade.
A Crime To Remember	The '80s	The case of the murder of the Franklin Bradshaw murder ends in the early part of this decade, as of 2018, the only time the 1980s was covered on this show and next to The Edwardian Era and The Roaring '20s as the least covered decades.
A Crime To Remember	Abusive Parents	A common occurrence in the series.
A Crime To Remember	Action Survivor	Barbara Mackle, as a young woman she was kidnapped and buried alive while recovering from an illness and survived. The narrator (a childhood friend) mentioned Barbara didn't come out traumatized from the experience to which the camera cuts to Barbara recalling a happy childhood ritual she did with her Mother around Christmas time and was noted as the most innocent in her group. She also happens to be one of the few main victims covered who survived and lived on to marry and start a family.
A Crime To Remember	Adaptational Attractiveness	While the actors hired can more or less resemble the people in the stories, some of the actors are more or less good-looking than their real-life counterparts. One example is Pearl O'Loughlin.
A Crime To Remember	The Bad Guy Wins	
A Crime To Remember	The Bluebeard	Paul Perveler attempted to kill his first wife, but she divorced him before he could finish the job. He succeeds in killing his second wife, but ends up getting caught afterwards.
A Crime To Remember	Confess in Confidence	In one case, only some aspects of the doctor-patient privilege were covered. In 1966, doctors were still bound by confidentiality, meaning that they couldn't discuss what their patients had told them in confidence. However, there had yet to be an actual universal regulation or law stating that this privilege could be lifted if the patient was considered a danger to themselves or others. This meant that even though the patient, Charles Whitman, admitted to his therapist that he thought about shooting people, all the doctor could legally do was suggest that Whitman come back later.
A Crime To Remember	Criminal Mind Games	The killer in "A New Kind of Monster" repeatedly taunted the police.
A Crime To Remember	Death of a Child	Some of these murders involve minors.

The narration points out that they both went through the same thing and understood.
A Crime To Remember	Formerly Fat	Kristina Cromwell from "The Newlydeads". She was an insecure, obese, dark haired clerical worker with glasses and unremarkable looks; after meeting her boyfriend Paul Perveler, he instructed her on a makeover that had her drop 75 lbs, lose the glasses, buy a new wardrobe, cap her teeth, and dye her hair platinum blonde.
A Crime To Remember	Good Bad Girl	Tied in with Slut-Shaming, two victims were considered the "bad girls" of their era but were said by colleagues to be very nice people.
A Crime To Remember	The Great Depression	The murder of Veronica Gedeon and her stepfather and mother, the case of Nellie May Madison, the Massie Trial, and the murder of Leona O'Loughlin by her stepmother Pearl all take place in this era.

A Crime To Remember	Innocent Bystander	Poor  Wendy Fritz was murdered for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

A Crime To Remember	Manipulative Bitch	Sharon Kinne, to Detective Browning's frustration, she manages to evade confession and the paraffin test (which was needed for fingerprints and involved hot wax), even when the police were listening in on her conversations she even evades that. It even bleeds into her personal life where she manipulated her in-laws (who disliked her and were blackmailed because Sharon would use their grandchild as a chess figure) into supporting her and even a mother with Skewed Priorities who enables her. She accuses Det. Browning of being grumpy (along with her mother) when he gets impatient at the women putting her mother's hair appointment before a criminal investigation interview. She even plays dumb willingly or wastes the investigators' time to the point where the police decide to charge her for her husband's murder and Patricia Jones's murder. Also when she convinces her in-laws that her second child was her late husband's baby even though she gave birth 10 months after he died....Roxie Hart would be shocked.
A Crime To Remember	Monochrome Casting	Most of the figures in the stories are White, the few times the stories are clear to be narrated by women of color are the cases about the LAPD Rape case and the Massie Trial to name a few.
A Crime To Remember	Nostalgia Filter	Averting and invoking this trope is the premise of the show, since the crimes are featured during what is considered the "golden age" of the U.S. Some of the experts will even say that a particular case was so shocking and horrible that the American public lost some of their innocence.
A Crime To Remember	Rape as Drama	In "Paradise Lost," Thalia Massie told police that she was raped by a group of Hawaiian men.
Aikatsu Planet	Internal Reveal	Kyoko and Mao eventually reveal their identities as Beat and Hana.
A Crime To Remember	Reluctant Psycho	Charles Whitman seemed to have some inkling that something was very wrong with him, leading him to go to a therapist for help. Unfortunately, this didn't work, as it turns out that this man had a tumor growing in his brain that caused more aggressive behavior.
A Crime To Remember	The Roaring '20s	The stories of Dolly Oesterrich and the murder by Leopold and Loeb all take place in this era.
A Crime To Remember	Secret Relationship	
A Crime To Remember	Skewed Priorities	Sharon Kinne's mother, what do you do when you are at the beauty parlor and your daughter (who was a suspect in the suspicious "accident" of her husband's death) needs you to babysit because she is being taken for a investigation interview because she manages to be connected to another murder? You fuss and fuss about how you cannot watch a child while getting your hair done and fuss about the detective being so grumpy when he rightfully insists on getting a move on.
A Crime To Remember	Slut-Shaming	Given that these crimes take place during the mid-20th century, there was still a lot of bias towards women in particular for what was deemed "inappropriate" behavior.
A Crime To Remember	Sole Survivor	Cora Amurao was the only survivor of a mass murder, with the other victims being her dormmates.
A Crime To Remember	Stay in the Kitchen	A common attitude and conflict that ran through the series.
A Crime To Remember	Stepford Smiler	A common occurrence with the families, victims, and murderers/criminals in the series. They were often appearing to be a magazine-ready family, the perfect son or daughter, or otherwise very exemplary and respectable by all appearances...until the events of the story happen and unravel what has been happening all along.
A Crime To Remember	The Stoic	Alice Crimmins is theorized to be this, as to why she didn't appear to be devastated after her kids went missing and were found murdered. She would drink and told a friend "my tears are for me, not for people to see".
A Crime To Remember	True Crime	The show is Type 2, with people who studied the case giving background and commentary about the cases.
A Crime To Remember	Villain with Good Publicity	Sharon Kinne, glamorous and movie star hot, gets a whiff of celebrity at the time of her trial which sadly eclipsed the fact a young wife was murdered by her (and also that Sharon killed her eldest daughter's father).
A Crime To Remember	Villainous Breakdown	In "The Pied Piper,"  Charlie Schmid apparently suffered one after the police picked him up for the murders. He was described as being filthy, stinking, wearing heavy pancake makeup and chapstick, and black grease over a beauty mark. He claimed that this made him look exactly like Elvis Presley.
A Crime To Remember	Would Hurt a Child	Many of the murderers featured on the series have murdered children, one shot his young niece and infant nephew execution style after offing their parents.
A Crime To Remember	Young Future Famous People	Vincent Bugliosi and F. Lee Bailey weren't the famous attorneys they became in the stories they took part in, after their cases (Sam and Marilyn Sheppard; the Pervelar Affair) they gained more traction in their profession and fame.
Adam 12	555	
Adam 12	The '70s	What happened to your hair, Reed? Ah.
Adam 12	Actor Allusion	Drunk driver Edward Brown in "Log 51: A Jumper, Code 2" is played by Hal Smith, best known for playing town drunk Otis Cambpell in The Andy Griffith Show.
Adam 12	Affectionate Parody	"Boredom-12", in MAD.
Adam 12	The Alleged Car	Malloy and Reed are assigned "The Beast," a patrol car only 300 miles away from its mandatory retirement, in the episode of the same title. It's so awful, Malloy even "lets" Reed drive for one of only a handful of times during the course of the series. The car finally meets its end when the brakes fail after Reed and Malloy jump out to pursue a suspect on foot and it rolls downhill into a tree.
Adam 12	Always on Duty	Webb did his best to avert this. It is made clear that our main characters are one team out of many working one shift out of many and that just as much happens off-camera as on. Early on, Malloy (and sometimes Mac) had to remind Reed that they were patrol officers and that more complicated cases were other people's responsibility.Malloy: Reed, the dicks have their job and we have ours.
Adam 12	Ammunition Conservation	Malloy tries to teach Reed to spare his ammunition, and shoot only when told to, or when he has a clear shot, especially since taking time to reload would put one in a vulnerable position, as shown when Malloy takes on a group of burglars.
Adam 12	And the Adventure Continues	The series ends with some unresolved questions (Will Reed try to take the investigator's exam? Will Malloy move on to a desk job as a supervisor?), but with a strong indicator that regardless both men will continue to carry a badge and do their job of protecting the citizens of Los Angeles.
Adam 12	Author Avatar	Malloy seems to be one for Jack Webb in the pilot, especially when he slips into Joe Friday's talking style during the Infodump listed below. (Webb directed the pilot).
Adam 12	The Bad Guys Are Cops	
Adam 12	Beware the Nice Ones	One episode involves a normally mild-mannered tailor from Trieste/Dubrovnik, who has recognized a customer as the Yugoslav Nazi who killed his brother. And he knows the Ustaše knows he's been recognized, so he lays a trap...
Adam 12	Being Personal Isn't Professional	Several times, Reed has to be reminded that he can't let his personal feelings get in the way of doing the job because that's a quick way to becoming unable to do the job at all.
Adam 12	Big Brother Mentor	At least one episode paid homage to Big Brothers Big Sisters, with both Malloy and Reed serving as mentors. The other usage is Malloy (the senior officer) serving as training officer for Reed in the early episodes.
Adam 12	Blackmail	The appropriately titled "IAD-Blackmail" has Pete discover that a fellow officer, Tony Johnson, is blackmailing a witness to keep quiet. Johnson tries to get Pete on his side after having saved Pete's life earlier in the episode, but Pete just gets ticked off about having his name drug into it.
Adam 12	Bottle Episode	The season two episode "Light Duty" takes place entirely within the police station, as Reed and Malloy man the front desk for a night while a riot brews elsewhere in the city. The season one episode "It All Happened So Fast," with the exception of the first three minutes (filmed on a Universal backlot street), takes place in an interview room at the police department.
Adam 12	Brand X	In the pilot there is one quick insert shot of the radio (one that doesn't quite match the radio usually shown in the car) that has tape over the Motorola name but leaves the M logo intact.
Adam 12	Sherlock Scan	In one episode, Reed figures out a car is using a stolen license plate because it doesn’t have a tag and there are dead bugs on it, meaning it used to be a front license plate.
Adam 12	Shout-Out	
Adam 12	Bringing Running Shoes to a Car Chase	In "Rampart Division: The Senior Citizens," the protagonists see a purse snatcher run into a graveyard with roads. They try to drive after him, but are blocked by a slow-moving car that enters the graveyard ahead of them. By the time they get out, he's escaped over a wall.
Adam 12	Broken Pedestal	Officer Tony Johnson saves Malloy's life, but Malloy later learns that Johnson is dirty, and using Malloy to try and cover up his corrupt acts.
Adam 12	Buddy Cop Show	Reed and Malloy are the best of friends on and off duty.
Adam 12	By-the-Book Cop	Most of the officers are reasonable. Malloy is completely willing to bend the nitpicky rules, particularly in an episode like "Suspended" where Reed's job is at stake. The obnoxiously by-the-book officers are figures of humour, often Obstructive Bureaucrats in uniform...including the cop that replaces Reed in "Suspended".
Adam 12	Call-Back	In "Follow Up", Jim is trying to get a reluctant Pete to split the cost of a used boat with him. Pete recalls buying one and that it "nickled and dimed him to death". This is referring to "A Fool and His Money", where Pete wins $10k in a contest and wants to buy a boat, despite Jim's urging to invest the money.
Adam 12	Call Sign	For radio brevity, every unit in the show was assigned a call sign which detailed the division, unit type and patrol area.
Adam 12	Camp Gay	The occasional run-ins with "out there" types. While Reed's reactions can sometimes stray toward Licensed Homophobe, Malloy and the show as a whole are non-judgmental.
Adam 12	Cannot Tell a Joke	Reed. He spends a good portion of the finale of season one trying to tell Malloy a joke about ... a dog... and paint... or something, suffering constant interruptions from calls (not his fault) and his own disjointed retelling (totally his fault), and then he's crushed when Malloy doesn't laugh, invoking So Unfunny, It's Funny. Also, Reed obsessing over Malloy's failure to laugh, to the extent that he explains the joke and is offended that Pete doesn't find it amusing, is completely adorable.
Adam 12	Caught Up in a Robbery	One episode has Reed end up wounded and taken hostage when he gets wrapped up in a bank robbery while doing his own business at the bank.
Adam 12	Chase Scene	Not that many episodes featured these; notably, the first episode had a car chase, where Malloy and Reed pursue two liquor store robbers down a highway under construction and the end result is Reed's first bust. There were far more foot pursuits than car chases, although enough police pursuits were scattered throughout the run to satisfy most viewers.
Adam 12	Car Chase Shoot-Out	Reed and Malloy end up in a car chase and start taking fire from the other car. Reed returns fire from the passenger seat and the other car goes off the road and hits a tree. In the aftermath, he's chewed out by their sergeant because it's against LAPD policy to shoot at a moving vehicle.
Adam 12	Da Chief	Mac essentially fills this role for Pete, Jim and the other uniformed officers, although in one or two episodes, we also saw the Captain pop up. Mac is more positive than a lot of other examples of this trope, though—more of a Reasonable Authority Figure sort.
Adam 12	Christmas Episode	Two of them. First is "Log 122: Christmas - The Yellow Dump Truck" in Season 1. Reed and Malloy pull over a drunk driver yelling "MERRY CHRISTMAS" out the car window, try to resolve a domestic dispute caused by the husband's Christmas splurging, and search for a stolen car containing a poor family's presents, including the titular dump truck. Second is "Log 96: Pilgrimage" in Season 3. They have to bust a charity Santa who clobbers the drunk who robbed him, handle a fatal DUI accident, deal with a recently-widowed shoplifter, and finally help a Native American family from New Mexico (on the titular pilgrimage) locate their lost girl.
Adam 12	Clear Their Name	A couple times.
Adam 12	Code Emergency	Adam-12 is the Trope Codifier for using routine codes on television: in this case, the Los Angeles Police code system. People soon learned many of the designations, some of which are still recognized today:
Adam 12	Comic-Book Adaptation	A Gold Key Comics adaptation ran for 10 issues.
Adam 12	Cool Car	Webb set out to make the patrol car the third star of the show, featuring it and its functions as much as possible.
Adam 12	Cop Killer	Only once, kind of surprising for a cop show, but the standards of the time discouraged violence. "Elegy For A Pig" centers on an officer killed in a shootout, and it was painted as probably the most dead-serious episode in the entire show; a black screen for the intro, and no music: just Jack Webb himself reading the credits.
Adam 12	Cop Show	
Adam 12	Couch Gag	Over the course of the series, it had numerous variations in its opening credits. Sometimes they took place during the day, other times at night, sometimes the officers were shown running towards their vehicle, sometimes they were already driving. Although there was consistency in the original broadcast, the random nature of TV syndication in the 1970s and 1980s meant that it was not uncommon to see a different opening with each episode.
Adam 12	Cowboy BeBop at His Computer	
Adam 12	Cowboy Cop	
Adam 12	CPR: Clean, Pretty, Reliable	In the first episode, Malloy preforms CPR on a suffocated infant, who is fine and dandy seconds later. Not at all unrealistic, however, dramatic as it was. Prompt administration of rescue breathing is effective in children in respiratory arrest. It's when respiratory arrest leads to cardiac arrest (which is usually the order of things in children—adults are usually in full arrest already following suffocation or near-drowning) when the odds of survival take a sharp dive. That applies for adults and children, but especially for children, who compensate well—up to a point. When they crash, they crash very hard. Besides which, the characters all treated it as something of a miracle—Malloy had instructed Reed to inform the parents that their daughter was all but dead already.
Adam 12	Crossover	with several other Jack Webb productions: Dragnet, Emergency!, and the short-lived Robert Conrad vehicle, The D.A.
Adam 12	Dating Service Disaster	In "Northwest Division," a computer dating service pairs a woman who self-describes as shy and retiring with a man who says he's a test pilot. They learn the truth when they run into each other at the grocery store where she's angrily picketing low prices and he works as a manager.
Adam 12	Dead Sidekick	
Adam 12	Deadpan Snarker	Malloy has a very dry sense of humor. He usually doesn't employ it against civilians, but Reed, MacDonald, Wells and others are frequent victims.
Adam 12	Death Glare	An integral part of Malloy's repertoire, especially when dealing with Reed, who likes to occasionally provoke him.
Adam 12	Death of a Child	A part of many real-life police work involves dealing with tragedies involving children, and Adam-12 was definitely no exception:
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	Bash Brothers	Semir Gerkhan and each of his many partners.
Adam 12	Deconfirmed Bachelor	For most of the series, Malloy is a confirmed bachelor who breaks out in hives at the mere mention of marriage. Then he meets a widow named Judy and before long he's doing her laundry, buying gifts for her son, dating her exclusively and well on his way to settling down.
Adam 12	Dirty Cop	A Truth in Television — Jack Webb (accurately) portrayed police officers as those whom people encounter every day: good, upstanding citizens and active members of their community, and most importantly honorable law enforcement officers dedicated to keeping people safe while keeping them safe from crime ... but Webb also didn't sugarcoat the truth, as he was well aware that police departments also had the occasional officer who thought the badge allowed him to beat up suspects, engage in racism and other crimes. Every time, those who discredit the badge or do wrong are quickly exposed by their very own (in this case, Reed and/or Malloy were involved in exposing the truth) and ousted from the force. The most notable examples were "Internal Affairs – Blackmail," where one of Malloy's best friends had secretly been blackmailing witnesses; and "Badge Heavy," where Reed witnesses a fellow officer choking out a suspect and eventually gets him to admit that officers need to be rough on suspects.
Adam 12	Distracted by the Sexy	
Adam 12	Double Take	Reed and Malloy both give and take strange calls. Giving:
Adam 12	Driving Test	An expired license forces Malloy to allow Reed to drive in the third season episode "Vice Versa".
Adam 12	Drunk Driver	Happened frequently enough, as would be expected on a show about patrol officers, that the police slang "deuce" (short for DUI) entered the vernacular. However, the writers came up with a few spins on it:
Adam 12	Eager Rookie	Reed, during the first season and early in the second. Although his turn into one of L.A.'s finest happened quickly, it was more evident as the second season progressed.
Adam 12	Eagle-Eye Detection	Arguably what makes Reed a very strong officer – his ability to observe, pay attention and analyze almost instantly what's going on. He can easily spot license plates that belong to wanted cars, to determine whether someone is a suspect (just by how he's behaving) ... to the very last episode, where the last case involves him cracking a typewriter theft ring by spotting the serial number and matching it with an advisory on the thefts. Malloy, too, in his own way. His experience helps him pick up on tells, missed details, and other clues. One good example of how both work is in "The Beast". They're told to investigate a warehouse with unusual activity. They arrive to see a bunch of men apparently loading boxes. Each has his own way of sensing something's amiss. Malloy noted the manifest he was given was two weeks out of date. Reed noticed the workers had unwrinkled clothes despite having supposedly drove in from Bakersfield, which is about 2 hours away.
Adam 12	Eat the Evidence	In "Gang War", Reed and Malloy lose track of a robber who had knocked over a gas station and a market. A few hours later, they get a call for a family dispute in the same area. The robber had gotten into a fight with his common-law wife, who called the cops. Reed and Malloy find the guy moaning in the bedroom - he'd also stolen some blintzes from the market, and the combination of unrefrigerated sour cream and a warm L.A. day gave him one nasty case of food poisoning.
Adam 12	Eco-Terrorist	In "The Ferret," the titular vandal attacks companies that damage the environment, doing a Janitor Impersonation Infiltration to get inside. He has enough fans that Reed becomes the subject of an unflattering newspaper article for trying to arrest him. He finally gets caught dumping a bucket of toxic sludge in an office, and gives a speech about pollution while he's being led away.
Adam 12	Every Car Is a Pinto	In the first-season episode "Log 62 Grand Theft Horse?", a Ford Falcon Adam-12 is pursuing fails to make a turn and hits a tree. The engine explodes on impact (or, from the way it appeared, explodes just before impact) but the car isn't destroyed.
Adam 12	Evil Has Standards	In "Log 122: Christmas - The Yellow Dump Truck," the man who's stolen a car with a colour TV on the back seat in appalled when he discovers he's accidentally stolen the gifts (for a needy family) in the trunk as well. Because the gifts weren't his target, Reed and Malloy are allowed to return the gifts instead of having them impounded as evidence along with the woman's car and TV.
Adam 12	Everything's Louder with Bagpipes	The last Christmas episode had Reed and Malloy receive a noise complaint about a tenant at a retirement home playing Christmas tunes on a set.
Adam 12	Expy	Picture Joe Friday in his uniform days. That's Malloy. Also, the team dynamic of happily-married X/confirmed-bachelor-playboy X is a typical feature of many other Jack Webb shows, including Emergency! and Dragnet.
Adam 12	Fake-Out Opening	The opening scene of "Training Division" features a group of robbers being pulled over and then taking out the arresting officers and the backup officers. Adam-12 then shows up...and then the camera pans to a group of trainees in street clothes, revealing that the entire scenario was a recreation of an actual incident. (It's supposedly based on the Newhall massacre, which resulted in the death of four California Highway Patrol officers.) The whole thing was a training exercise, where Mac and other officers explain how an incident like this should have been handled and, if done correctly, would have resulted in just the arrests and nothing else.
Adam 12	False Rape Accusation	"Day Watch" has a teenage hitchhiker who tells the men who pick her up that she'll accuse them of rape if they don't give her twenty dollars. The first guy pays up, then immediately calls the police. The second guy doesn't pay, and Malloy and Reed arrive to find her loudly accusing him of trying to molest her. Luckily he recorded their conversation.
Adam 12	Female Gaze	Reasonably attractive actors in tight cop uniforms. It's a Cop Show, fair enough. But then there are Anvilicious seat-belt buckling scenes (because all good, socially responsible people buckle their seat-belts) and the camera likes to focus directly on Reed or Malloy's crotch while they perform the maneuver. Remember kids, buckle your seat-belts, and let it not be said, ladies, that Jack Webb never pandered to your interests.
Adam 12	Foreshadowing	In "Astro Division", Reed and Malloy are getting help from the department helicopters. Reed says he wonders what the view is like from one of them, and Malloy says that maybe one day he'll find out. Both officers later went up in helicopters in the two part episode "Skywatch".
Adam 12	Fowl-Mouthed Parrot	In "Training Wheels," Reed and Malloy stop a driver for running a stop sign. They then hear a high-pitched "Down with the pigs!", so the driver opens the trunk to reveal a mynah bird belonging to his cop-hating girlfriend.
Adam 12	Generic Cop Badges	Averted. The badges shown are authentic, as the series' police consultant brought them to the set and took them back to LAPD Headquarters once filming was done every day.
Adam Adamant Lives	Designated Girl Fight	In "The Sweet Smell of Disaster" and "The Terribly Happy Embalmers", Adam fights the villain while Georgina tackles his female accomplice.
Adam 12	"Getting My Own Room" Plot	A string of small item thefts in a neighborhood leads the officers to a kid who stole the stuff and set it up in a cave because his stepdad wouldn't give him his own room. The problem is, the cave collapses and the boy nearly dies.
Adam 12	Happily Married	Jim and Jean Reed. Frequently averted with couples encountered on calls, who are often enmeshed in the Masochism Tango or perplexing relationships where there is just No Accounting for Taste. The Reeds' marriage is shown to be under significant strain during the final season, but by the series finale, it appears they've smoothed things over a bit.
Adam 12	Hero Does Public Service	Malloy is shown coaching kids' basketball in one episode. It turns into Pete and Jim trying to help a drug-addicted player before it's too late. The kid's brother gets into the guy's stash and dies.
Adam 12	Heroic Bystander	In one episode, involving a deranged sniper with a grudge against the people in the neighborhood, a motorcycle cop comes along who hadn't heard the warning because his radio was kaput. The sniper wounds him, and then a bystander takes him to safety at great personal risk.
Adam 12	Hidden Purpose Test	Happened a few times in the early seasons, where Malloy would tell Reed to make a judgment call based on what he knows and has observed or ask Reed what his thought process was regarding a decision he made. Most of the time, it was not testing Reed's ability to recite the law or the rulebook but how Reed combines his intellect, observation and moral center under pressure to reach a decision in a hurry.
Adam 12	Hippie Van	
Adam 12	Hospitality for Heroes	Every once in a while a citizen wants to reward them for doing their job. Once, after being offered a couple free tacos for stopping a robbery in progress at a drive-in, Malloy says they can't accept "gratuities" and the puzzled waitress says "A taco is a gratuity?"
Adam 12	Hostage Situation	Too many to count. Reed, Malloy, or both got involved in a few of them.
Adam 12	Hostile Hitchhiker	In "Log 66: Vandals," two hitchhikers try to mug a girl who picked them up. When she resists, they kill her and hide the body in the trunk.
Adam 12	I Call It "Vera"	In "Log 93: Once a Junkie," a man calls the police to report the theft of his gun, Baby.
Adam 12	Idiosyncratic Episode Naming	
Adam 12	Impersonating an Officer	In one episode there's someone out there claiming to be a particular detective in the LAPD, flashing his badge around and insisting on bribes. They aren't sure until the end of the episode whether it's really that cop turned bad or someone impersonating him. It's someone impersonating him.
Adam 12	Infodump	Pretty common in all Jack Webb shows. Here's Malloy in the first episode, running down the specs of Adam-12:Malloy: You know what this is?Reed: (smiling) Yes sir, it's a police car.Malloy: This black and white patrol car has an overhead valve V8 engine. It develops 325 horsepower at 4800 RPM's. It accelerates from 0 to 60 in seven seconds; it has a top speed of 120 miles an hour. It's equipped with a multi-channeled DFE radio and an electronic siren capable of emitting three variables: wail, yelp, and alert. It also serves as an outside radio speaker and a public address system. The automobile has two shotgun racks - one attached to the bottom portion of the front seat, one in the vehicle trunk. Attached to the middle of the dash, illuminated by a single bulb, is a hot sheet desk, fastened to which you will always make sure is the latest one off the teletype before you ever roll.Reed: Yes, sir.Malloy: [deep breath, sigh] It's your life insurance...and mine. You take care of it, it'll take care of you.Reed: Yes, sir. You want me to drive?Malloy: (death glare)
Adam 12	In-Series Nickname	It's mentioned in one episode that Pete is, to some, "The Strawberry Fox".
Adam 12	The Informant	A few episodes had Reed and Malloy meet up with an informant named T.J., a reformed petty crook who still is connected enough to hear about possible crimes and drug deals going down.
Adam 12	Instrumental Theme Tune	The theme music is a driving, energetic piece which, in places, manages to be quite reminiscent of the wail of a police siren. There are no lyrics.
Adam 12	Juggling Loaded Guns	Officer Brinkman in "Taking It Easy". He tries to clear a jammed shotgun round in the station parking lot, only for the gun to go off and cause a panic. Then, when demonstrating to Mac what he was trying to do the gun goes off again. Mac tells him to take the shotgun up to the armory and let them take care of it.
Adam 12	Know-Nothing Know-It-All	A few examples:
Adam 12	Lampshade Hanging	
Adam 12	Large Ham	Studiously averted by the regular cast, but fairly common among guest stars, often in "eccentric citizen" or "funny drunk" roles. Known Large Hams appearing in more than one episode include Foster Brooks, Norm Crosby, and Rose Marie.
Adam 12	Leaning on the Fourth Wall	Once in a while, someone mentions cop shows. For example, in "Log 26: LEMRAS": (A woman hostage stomps on a robber with her high heels, allowing police to capture him.)Malloy: Where did you learn to use your heel like that?Woman: I watched a lot of cop shows on TV.
Adam 12	Meaningful Name	One episode features an unpleasant buff named Thornton. Guess what he is in Reed and Malloy's sides.
Adam 12	Mercy Kill	
Adam 12	Mirror Character	In the first episode, Malloy lists the many shortcomings that Reed has and that about the only thing Reed does well is "wear the uniform right". The Lieutenant says that he said many of the same things to his watch commander about a rookie he got saddled with years ago - a brash hot-shot by the name of Pete Malloy.
Adam 12	Mood Whiplash	
Adam 12	Myth Arc	It's not very evident due to the tendency of Jack Webb's shows towards Status Quo Is God, but there is an overarching storyline which begins with the pilot and concludes in the series finale - Reed's development from an eager, idealistic, very happily married rookie into, in the seventh season, a somewhat cynical, world-weary veteran whose job is having a negative effect on his home life. The series finale brings things full circle by very nearly placing Reed in the same shoes Malloy was wearing in the pilot.
Adam 12	Naïve Newcomer	Reed, in the first two seasons (which represent his probationary first year). A few one-off characters throughout the series.
Adam 12	Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!	In "The Dinosaur," a cop who suffered a seemingly Career-Ending Injury eight years ago is finally recovered enough to go back to work, and Reed and Malloy are assigned to retrain him. Unfortunately, he has a hard time adjusting to modern procedure, most notably the Miranda Rights, causing him to foul up multiple arrests. In the end, a stalker he arrests gets Off on a Technicality and goes on to almost kill his ex-wife with a Car Bomb, leading the cop to quit the force so no one else gets hurt.
Adam Adamant Lives	Pretty in Mink	Jones wears a white fox stole when she infiltrates an evil escort service in "Death By Appointment Only".
Adam 12	Nice Job Fixing It, Villain!	In one episode, Malloy is injured in a crash, and the (already faulty) radio is disabled. Then a murderer with nothing to lose happens by, and, not realizing the radio is kaput, pulls the mike out. Malloy is able to cross the now-exposed wires to signal ***---*** in Morse Code.
Adam 12	No-Respect Guy	Every so often, the police's bad publicity with the public turns up, such as when suspects call the cops "pigs" (long-standing police epithet), or when crowds complain when they're told to break up. One time ("Pilgrimage"), Malloy and Reed have no choice but to arrest a charity Santa for wailing on the guy who mugged him earlier. Hearing a little girl cry out, "Mommy, look! He's arresting Santy Claus!" just makes the job even less pleasant.
Adam 12	"Not Making This Up" Disclaimer	Like Dragnet, Adam-12 stories were taken from actual police files, so the show used a Dragnet-like disclaimer at the end of its episodes: "The incidents you have seen are true. The names were changed to protect the innocent."
Adam 12	Not With the Safety On, You Won't	Malloy chases a suspect with a shotgun over a hilltop to find the shotgun leveled at him. Then the suspect gives up. Turned out he left the safety on by mistake and pulled the trigger so hard it broke.
Adam 12	Oh, Crap!	One episode opens with Reed and Malloy going to aid a camper driver—then discovering too late that it's a trap.Malloy: SETUP!
Adam 12	Old Cop, Young Cop	Malloy's not old, but he is a seasoned veteran with many years experience as a patrolman working with a fresh out of the Academy rookie who he has to put through his paces and see if Reed will measure up. After Reed passes probation, there are episodes where Malloy is assigned a rookie partner while Reed is on desk duty or involved in another assignment.
Adam 12	Once for Yes, Twice for No	Used in "The Search," because the radio is damaged and the only way Malloy can communicate is by tapping the exposed wires together.
Adam 12	One Bullet Left	Several times throughout the course of the series, most notably in a 1969 episode where, during Reed's rookie days, he and Malloy are engaged in a burglary-in-progress call at a warehouse, which ends in a shootout. Malloy stresses to Reed how important it is to not shoot unless absolutely necessary or if ordered to. Reed follows the orders to a "T" and ... after the suspects are all successfully taken in custody, Reed sees exactly why it was a good idea he listened: Malloy's gun had just one bullet left, and any time spent reloading gives the bad guys – who think they have nothing to lose – the opening they need.
Adam 12	Only Sane Man	Frequently both Reed and Malloy, when they're interacting with the odder elements of society. Malloy often feels this way among even his fellow officers.Pete: "The world is full of squirrels."
Adam 12	Our Mermaids Are Different	The third season episode "Post Time" features Morey Amsterdam as a Printer named Jerry Mermaid, whose printing press is stolen.Jerry Mermaid: I'm Mermaid, Jerry Mermaid. And before you say anything, I've heard all the jokes! 'Oh, was your dad a crab and your mother a barracuda?' Ha ha ha!
Adam 12	Phonetic Alphabet	Rare is the episode that doesn't feature the LAPD phonetic alphabet. It's constantly used when announcing unit call signs and license plates over the radio.
Adam 12	Police Are Useless	A few one-offs, some of whom realize they aren't cut out for the job and others who have to be forced out. Ed Wells is a mild example, in that he tends to believe his way is the correct way to handle a situation...only for the situation to be badly mishandled.
Adam 12	Police Brutality	
Adam 12	Police Procedural	Most episodes focus strictly on the day-to-day routine of policework, including the less exciting aspects of the job (paperwork, pre-shift briefings, inspections, car trouble, tedious calls, ungrateful citizens, etc.).
Adam 12	Poorly Disguised Pilot	Season 6, Episode 24's A Clinic on 18th Street is the pilot for a show featuring the DA Office's Fraud Division. The cast of the pilot (including future Switch (1975)/Cagney & Lacey star Sharon Gless who gets the Welcome Episode treatment), are all listed in the opening credits as "Special Guest Stars". Reed and Malloy only appear in the very begining and very ending of this story of a Doctor peddling electronic health belts to diabetics and fake blindness cures to little girls. Jack Webb directed, but not in his trademark Dragnet style.
Adam 12	Porn Stache	Pete grows one in "Van Nuys Division". Jim annoys him about it the whole time. By the end of the ep, it's gone, due to what Pete describes as trimming mishaps.
Adam 12	The Precarious Ledge	In one episode Reed and Malloy encounter a jumper on one of these. Malloy goes out on the ledge to pull him back in. Mac gives him a massive chewing-out for this.
Adam 12	Precious Puppies	eed: Well....he is a police dog....
Adam 12	Product Displacement	In most episodes when there is a closeup on a stationary vehicle, there is almost always a strip of silver tape covering the name brand of the vehicle. The name of the specific model may also be covered. Some cars and trucks would have the names painted over with a matching color.
Adam 12	Punk in the Trunk	In "Trouble in the Bank," two bank robbers take Reed hostage, force him into their car, and drive off, not knowing that Malloy is hiding in the trunk with a radio, reporting their position.
Adam 12	Rank Up	Mostly Pete. He starts out as a regular officer, but by the series' end, he is one step short of Sergeant. Jim may count too, going from probationary to regular patrol officer, and possibly further, although we are never told one way or another what he decides in the last episode.
Adam 12	Reasonable Authority Figure	The raison d'être of several of Jack Webb's productions is to portray the police and other avatars of the Establishment in this light.
Adam 12	Red Oni, Blue Oni	At least in the pilot, but subverted by the nature of Jack Webb procedurals. As the more learned and world-weary Malloy (Blue) starts to mold the impulsive, eager Reed (Red), they converge into a sort of Purple Oni. Adherence to reality - job codes, paperwork, procedure - is required at all times by the script and show philosophy, meaning the two never get to burn very brightly in their respective colors.
Adam 12	Required Spinoff Crossover	With both Dragnet which it spun off from and its sister series Emergency!.
Adam 12	Roman à Clef	Occasionally drifts into 'loose interpretation' territory.
Adam 12	Running Gag	A very minor one in that usually when Jim and Pete really want to take their lunch break, something interferes with it. Pete even makes a joke in one episode about how he knows they're about to get a call because he's starving and the shift has been pretty dull so far.
Adam 12	Sarcastic Clapping	In "Dirt Duel," a group of cop-hating bikers show up to a meeting. When it's mentioned that a civilian helped catch a thief, everyone applauds. One of the bikers (played by Micky Dolenz) joins in.
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	Naïve Newcomer	Jenny Dorn when she is assigned to the Autobahn police.
Adam 12	Shown Their Work	As mentioned in the main description. Small subplots in episodes included having to rewrite reports to fix errors, report for firearms qualification, go to court to testify in cases, and the other day-to-day drudgery that patrol officers have to deal with between radio calls.
Adam 12	Stalker with a Crush	The innocuous variety. An attractive young blonde begins showing up at the precinct, sends suggestive photos, and even tries to follow Malloy home. It's okay because the stalker is a woman and Malloy is a man.
Adam 12	Stay in the Kitchen	Wells. He never stops complaining about the female officer who rides patrol with Reed in one episode, though it does get toned down a little after she proves herself during a concert riot and even has to save him.
Adam 12	Story Arc	Several short ones occur over the course of the series, mainly in the early seasons - one which involves a restaurant owner named Duke, another revolving around an informant named T.J., yet another dealing with the events leading up to and following the birth of James Reed, Jr. Season six features a recurring burglar named Reno West, and in the seventh season both Reed and his wife begin to feel dissatisfied with his job, which comes to a head in the two-part series finale.
Adam 12	Strawman U	Malloy goes back to school to finish his degree in one episode, but this being The '60s he gets guff from student activists for being a cop. Then he has to respond in uniform to a sit-in at the school, for which his car is vandalized.
Adam 12	Team Dad	Malloy, who in his stern way sometimes chides other officers in the division that they should "listen to daddy." He's also later of a rank (Police Officer III+1, which is one step below sergeant) and seniority that is "almost as good as a sergeant."
Adam 12	These Hands Have Killed	Season one, "It All Happened So Fast", where Reed makes his first kill in the line of duty. The show goes to great lengths to show how seriously the department takes such incidents (similar to the Dragnet episode "The Shooting Board") as well as the emotional roller coaster Reed experiences shortly after, with Malloy assuring him even he went through it with his first kill. The whole episode shows Reed (and cops in general) is human like everyone else. They don't get a kick out of shooting people; it may get easier, but they usually don't like it. The subject is brought up again in "Elegy for a Pig".
Adam 12	Title Drop	Constantly. Probably sets some sort of record. In addition, the title of an individual episode is often stated word-for-word in the episode.
Adam 12	Totally Radical	unkie: (to Malloy after being rescued from a burning building) Hey...I wanna...thank you...you saved our lives...you guys in the Fire Department...man, I'll tell ya...you're the greatest.Malloy: Wrong department, friend. We're the police.Junkie: Fuzz...lousy, stinking fuzz!Malloy: Don't give it another thought.
Adam 12	Tranquil Fury	Pete has his moments of this. He can get emotionally angry, but on the flip side, when he gets a Death Glare and a low, angry growl in his voice, you also know he’s really ticked off.
Adam 12	Translation by Volume	In "Astro," the only person at a residence who is available to tell the officers why they were called speaks very little English. They manage limited communication using pantomime, but Malloy, for some reason, also tries repeating his questions VERY LOUDLY.
Adam 12	Very Special Episode	The season three episode "Log 105: Elegy for a Pig." It's made more as a documentary. The regular opening credits were replaced by Jack Webb reading them over a black screen. Martin Milner narrated the episode in character. The policeman the episode revolves around, Tom Porter, had not been seen on screen before despite being a friend of Malloy and Reed's, going through the police academy with the former. No lines are spoken by any character on screen. Also, the two-parter "Clear with a Civilian" which features a woman named Edna Dixon, originally thought to be a civilian but later revealed to be a Police Commissioner. The character is actually representative (as noted in a Special Thanks in the end credits) of LAPD Commissioner Marguerite P. Justice: at the time the only female police commissioner in the United States.
Adam 12	The Voice	Real-life LAPD dispatcher Shaaron Claridge. She appears on-screen in one episode, helping Malloy run plate numbers on a dispatch computer, though only in an over-the-shoulder shot. It's possible she got recognized enough on her voice alone.
Adam 12	Watch the Paint Job	Once in a while, Malloy and Reed's car does suffer a little abuse:
Adam 12	Waving Signs Around	
Adam 12	Welcome Episode	In the pilot, veteran Malloy shows rookie Reed the ropes, which sets up their relationship for the next few seasons.
Adam 12	Well-Intentioned Extremist	"Militants" and "The Radical" feature militant fanatics, and "The Ferret" features a vandal who wants a major polluter to realize what they're doing—it's just his method is off-base.
Adam 12	What a Senseless Waste of Human Life	Many episodes that depict the death of innocent (and sometimes, not-so-innocent) people. A few examples:Malloy: Three dollars for every year of his life.
Adam 12	What the Hell, Hero?	
Adam 12	Wunza Plot	Reed is a Happily Married family man, while Malloy is a freewheeling bachelor. Reed is full of youthful enthusiasm as a fresh-faced rookie while Malloy is usually level-headed and practical as the by-the-book veteran. They fight crime.
Adam 12	You Are in Command Now	
Adam 12	You Owe Me	In "Blackmail", Officer Johnson saves Pete's life during a shootout in the beginning of the episode. Later, Pete discovers that Johnson was taking bribes from a witness in another case being investigated. Johnson tries to throw it back and Pete when confronted, and say that Pete owes him for saving Pete's life, but naturally, Pete doesn't go for it and just gets more ticked off.
Adam 12	Your Little Dismissive Diminutive	In "Killing Ground," two armed robbers take Reed and Malloy hostage. One of them makes fun of the police and their "little tests" and "little review boards." It turns out he's bitter because he wanted to become a cop, but was deemed too mentally unstable. Towards the end, he loses it completely and yells "LITTLE TESTS! LITTLE BOARDS!" over and over again.
AD The Bible Continues	Adaptation Expansion	The turbulent, violent political situation in 1st-century AD Judea is played up for Rule of Drama, as is personal drama among the early Christians.
AD The Bible Continues	Adaptational Heroism	The show makes an effort to show Caiaphas and Herod Antipas as Anti Villains compared to their portrayals in the gospels, due to being under Rome's thumb.
AD The Bible Continues	Adaptational Villainy	Conversely, Pilate is shown to be more ruthless and brutal than his portrayal in the gospels, which is more akin to what other ancient sources say about him. But even he is an Anti-Villain, especially compared to the likes of Caligula.
Adam Adamant Lives	Putting on the Reich	The private security form Surveillance Services make deliberate use of Nazi imagery, down to the salutes, black uniforms, and SS collar flashes.
AD The Bible Continues	Apocalypse How	Class 0 seems to be on the move in Israel, to be spearheaded by the installation of Caligula's statue in the Temple. (Note that there are scholarly arguments making this case as an interpretation of one of Jesus's prophecies.)
AD The Bible Continues	Artistic License – History	Emperor Tiberius and the future Emperor Caligula never visited Jerusalem. The show depicts Tiberius as going there to confront Pilate, but in real life Pilate was recalled back to Rome. Also, Caligula's rise to power came after Pilate was recalled, as did that whole incident with him trying to put an idol of himself in the Holy of Holies in the Temple at Jerusalem.
AD The Bible Continues	Ascended Extra	Caiaphas, Pontius Pilate, Claudia, Mary Magdalene, Joanna and Simon all have much more prominent roles beyond their initial appearances in the Bible. Indeed, only Caiaphas specifically appears in the Book of Acts, on which the series is most directly based.
AD The Bible Continues	Bible Times	The series takes place during the biblical events of 1st-century AD, which also coincided with the events of Roman history.
AD The Bible Continues	The Caligula	The Trope Namer himself shows up, being portrayed as insanely-spoiled and responsible for the murder of his uncle Emperor Tiberius. "Caligula" is correctly said to be an Embarrassing Nickname.
AD The Bible Continues	Canon Foreigner	
AD The Bible Continues	The Cassandra	Pilate's wife Claudia, to some extent. Everything she tries to tell or convince Pilate to do regarding the Jews, the Christians or Caligula is almost often ignored, with her fears coming true only after it's too late.
AD The Bible Continues	The Chains of Commanding	Caiaphas, Pilate, Herod Antipas and Emperor Tiberius all show this in one form or another. Considering they face the perceived threat of the growing Christian community (with the power relations they have built up with each other, all in order to preserve the tenuous peace between Judea and Rome, fraying the edges), you can understand why they are stressed out of their wits. For the Christians, Peter gets hit hard with this, as he sacrifices his home life with his daughter Maya to lead them.
AD The Bible Continues	Chronic Backstabbing Disorder	Leah goes from backstabbing her father and brother, to backstabbing the Zealots, to backstabbing her husband.  This ultimately gets her killed.
AD The Bible Continues	Cold-Blooded Torture	Whether crucifixions, floggings, or branding with hot coals, the Roman centurions have it down to routine.
AD The Bible Continues	Crusading Widow	Boaz's fiancée Eva eventually joins the Zealots after his capture and execution. She seems to have gained their trust too, considering  she becomes their gatekeeper and a recruiter, who confronts Simon (the Zealot) after he seemingly has a falling-out with the apostles regarding Saul's baptism.
AD The Bible Continues	Deadpan Snarker	Pilate gives off this impression with some of his statements.Caiaphas: [Jesus] spread rumor that He would rise from His own death after three days.Pilate: Roman Crucifixion really doesn't allow for that, Caiaphas.
AD The Bible Continues	Depraved Homosexual	The portrayed "friendship" between Caligula and Herod Agrippa is filled to the brim with every interaction they have, and they are not hesitating to harass other people too.
AD The Bible Continues	Didn't Think This Through	Caligula's command to place a golden statue of himself in the Temple of Jerusalem throws the already-precarious relationship between Pilate and the Jewish leaders out of whack. Threats of revolt and war were pretty much thrown between Pilate, Caiaphas and Antipas due to this.
AD The Bible Continues	The Fundamentalist	Saul was a dyed-in-the-wool partisan of the Sanhedrin, with his venal opposition to what Jesus and the early Christian community represents terrifying to behold. This, of course, was virtually wiped out after his encounter in Damascus with Jesus.
AD The Bible Continues	Ham-to-Ham Combat	When Peter and Saul finally confront each other in the climax of the sixth episode (which involved the entire Christian camp going up in flames): Saul: [incoherent screaming] I! WILL! CRUSH! YOU!!! Peter: You will try! YOU! WILL! TRY!
AD The Bible Continues	Heroic Sacrifice	
AD The Bible Continues	Hot-Blooded	Stephen the Proto-martyr is portrayed in this fashion, with this getting him killed (as noted above). Saul himself became very enthusiastically violent after he gained authority to suppress the Christians.
AD The Bible Continues	Ironic Echo	
AD The Bible Continues	It's Personal	At first, Peter is understandably reluctant to embrace the converted Saul because he had threatened his daughter.
AD The Bible Continues	Kneel Before Zod	Caligula to Pontius Pilate, Claudia, and all who in are his presence once he becomes The Emperor.
AD The Bible Continues	La Résistance	The Zealots appear, stalking Roman soldiers to stab them. But in the first episode this is averted when the Romans notice and get away. Later, apostles Matthew and Simon are mistaken for Zealots while they are sneaking into Jerusalem. They run away only to be accosted by real Zealots.
AD The Bible Continues	Lady Macbeth	Caiphas's wife Leah and Pilate's wife Claudia embody this in one way or another. Leah panders to most stereotypes of it (being the one to more often than not scheme and plot behind Caiaphas's back to help him discredit the Apostles), while Claudia seems to be a more benevolent one (trying her best to rein in Pilate's tyrannical actions against the Jews and politically maneuvering him between Tiberius and Caligula).
AD The Bible Continues	Large Ham	In true Bible Times fashion, the Apostles tend to hog the scenery when they preach. Saul of Tarsus is no slouch in the department either.
AD The Bible Continues	Mercy Kill	When Boaz is being tortured to death in public by the Romans, his superior, named Levi, shoots him dead from a rooftop.
AD The Bible Continues	The Mole	Mary Magdalene apparently chose to go undercover and join Pontius Pilate's household, in order to find out the political maneuverings amongst the Jewish and Roman officials which will endanger Christians.
AD The Bible Continues	My God, What Have I Done?	Cornelius has this moment after he  executes Joanna. This causes him to turn to Christianity for forgiveness.
AD The Bible Continues	My Master, Right or Wrong	Cornelius' attitude to Pilate.Cornelius: I'm a soldier. I don't have opinions. And Rome only thrives because men like me obey orders.
AD The Bible Continues	One-Steve Limit	In the source material, several people have the same names. This is handled in the show by simply not calling attention to it much. So Simon Peter is just called Peter while Simon the Zealot is called Simon (and his possible link to actual Zealots are omitted, at least at first), etc. An exception is made for Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Jesus.
AD The Bible Continues	Our Angels Are Different	Similar to The Bible (2013), the angel that opens Jesus's tomb is depicted as a human in armor, only glowing.
AD The Bible Continues	Out-Gambitted	Pilate's wife Claudia tried to extricate Pilate from his current post via currying good favor with Tiberius into appointing him into a good administrative position in Rome. Pilate's bad relationship with Caligula, however, backfires on the entire plan as Caligula murders Tiberius, assumes the title of Emperor, and revokes this appointment.
AD The Bible Continues	Pride	Saul's conversation with his fellow Jewish partisans imply that his opposition to the Apostles' ministry is not really entirely doctrinal/ideological, but more about how he cannot accept that God's truth was entrusted to "lowly fishermen" like them and not to a traditionally-elite Jewish man like himself.
AD The Bible Continues	Put on the Bus	Saul, after Leah and the Zealots put a hit out on him following his conversion.
AD The Bible Continues	Race Lift	Mary Magdalene, John, his brother James, and Philip are portrayed as having African ancestrynote Chipo Chung, the actress who plays Mary, is actually Afro-Chinese and Joanna as South Asian, instead of conventionally Semitic.
AD The Bible Continues	Reasonable Authority Figure	
AD The Bible Continues	Shame If Something Happened	Leah's favorite tactic when convincing people who saw the Apostles' actions to remain silent. Saul also did this to Peter's daughter Maya, which is why it was difficult for Peter to accept his conversion at first.
AD The Bible Continues	Some of My Best Friends Are X	Looking at it up-close, this is the essence of the relationship between the Tetrarch of Galillee (Herod), the High Priest (Caiaphas) and the Roman Governor of Judea (Pilate): as long as their policies are in sync, peace between Rome and Judea is possible. Deconstructed, however, by the reality that despite these nominal titles, it is still Rome who runs the show. This was Lampshaded by a confrontation between Claudia and Leah, where the former's indignation as a Roman noblewoman at being put upon by a Jewish noblewoman's critique of the current condition becomes the latter's justification of her discontent.
AD The Bible Continues	Tag Along Kid	Peter's daughter Maya tags along with the disciples in Jerusalem.
AD The Bible Continues	Villain Protagonist	Caiaphas and Pontius Pilate are as much protagonists as Peter and the apostles. Caiaphas in particular may be considered an Anti-Villain.
AD The Bible Continues	Well-Intentioned Extremist	Caiaphas, Pontius Pilate and the Zealots are only concerned with their nation's security, and are willing to kill or let people die for it.
AD The Bible Continues	You Monster!	Uttered by Claudia to Pilate in the eleventh episode, after he tells her that  Joanna is going to be executed.

Adam Adamant Lives	Bunny-Ears Lawyer	Adam is effectively from a different culture, was quirky for his time, is very old-fashioned in many ways, obsesses over finding furniture that belonged to his family, and wears old-fashioned clothes and an opera cape. Most people look at him a little strangely and wonder if he is as effective as claimed.

Adam Adamant Lives	Chairman of the Brawl	In "Death By Appointment Only", Adam uses a chair to fend off a villain who has stolen his Sword Cane.
Adam Adamant Lives	Chaste Hero	Subverted (see Celibate Hero above). He can come across as this to others because he's not used to women being as forward as they are in the '60s.
Adam Adamant Lives	Combat Pragmatist	For a gentleman with a high moral code in most things, Adam can be quite the dirty fighter, from trashcan lids to chairs, from kicking a man when he's down to hitting a woman (only if she is directly about to kill someone else), he'll usually take a villain and his or her mooks down by whatever means possible.
Adam Adamant Lives	The Comically Serious	Adam when trying to understand '60s concepts, inventions, and slang.

Adam Adamant Lives	Good Old Ways	Adam sticks to his courtesy, old-fashioned dress sense, and considers his time to have been more genteel era (however, he does make some concessions of approval concerning the '60s, like that prejudice is less and the class system is not so tightly stratified).

Adam Adamant Lives	May Contain Evil	"The Sweet Smell of Disaster".

He even got sent letters about Adam from boyfriends of female fans, some complaining that now their girlfriends expected them to act like him (and some thanking Harper for playing Adam because it inspired them to continue to be or start to be a gentleman.)

Adam Adamant Lives	You Have Outlived Your Usefulness	In "Black Echo",  Louise very literally outlives her usefulness to the Face. Her sixty-five years of faithful service count for nothing with him; he leaves her to die in Adamant's arms while he makes his getaway with his new, younger sidekick.
Adam Adamant Lives	You're Insane!	Adam, to the villain of "Beauty, is an Ugly Word": "You do realize that you are completely insane?" He is promptly proved right, as, shortly afterward, the villain has reached the point of claiming that A God He Is.
Adam Adamant Lives	Adaptational Hairstyle Change	Along with being a brunette, Georgina keeps her hair short on the boxset covers while in the TV series it was long.
Adam Adamant Lives	Adaptational Sexuality	It's more or less stated that Georgina is gay in this series, while her original tv series counterpart was straight.
Adam Adamant Lives	Adaptation Dye-Job	Georgina was a blonde in the TV series, but the covers for the boxset show she's a brunette like her voice actress.
Adam Adamant Lives	Adaptation Personality Change	Rather than being a Loony Fan Georgina Jones is an Everyman sort of character who is more of a fan of the Edwardian time period in general rather than just Adamant, with dreams of one day becoming a writer. Adam himself is more or less the same as the original, but is a bit of a Stepford Smiler and doesn’t share his classic counterpart’s blind spot regarding women.
Adam Adamant Lives	Ambiguous Situation	Unlike the original, it is not entirely clear how Adam Adamant got transported to the ’60s. The first episode opens with a confused and delirious Adamant getting hit by a car and he can’t remember how he got there, and despite insisting that he is who he says he is he doesn't actually have any proof. The possibility that he's actually a very delusional man who just thinks he's Adamant is treated as being very likely, which contributes to Adam's Stepford Smiler attitude.
Adam Adamant Lives	Cliffhanger	Volume 1 ends with a depressed Adam  leaving Georgina’s funeral and deciding to retire, believing there is no place for him in the ’60s.  Meanwhile a very much alive Georgina is being held captive by a man claiming to be The Face.
Adam Adamant Lives	Continuity Reboot	Unlike with most Big Finish ranges based on old television series, which are a Distant Sequel to the original series with the original cast reprising their roles, this range is a complete reboot with a darker tone, altered personalities for the characters and a slightly different story.
Adam Adamant Lives	Darker and Edgier	The very first story starts with characters discussing how many lesbians during The '60s were victims of horrific hate crimes, setting the tone for the rest of the series. While overall true to the spirit of the original series, the audios deal more heavily with death and violence along with other mature subjects.
Adam Adamant Lives	The Ghost	The Face. Adam's Arch-Enemy remains a constant presence in his mind, to the point were Adam imagines constant conversations between the two. He did not seem to get transported with Adamant to the ’60s and there is just as much ambiguity of his existence as Adam's identity.  The man at Volume 1's Cliffhanger, he's not the original Face and is just a disgraced psychiatrist who took the identity in a twisted Replacement Goldfish scheme.
Adam Adamant Lives	Shout-Out	Simms at one point turns on the radio and the song playing is by John Smith and the Common Men.
Adam Adamant Lives	Stepford Smiler	Adam often hides his worries and doubts, especially in regards to his own identity. Despite how much he wants to, he can't prove that he really is the Adam Adamant from the Edwardian era and deep down is terrified that he might actually be insane. However he doesn't discuss this with anyone and instead tries to keep up the impression of being an old fashioned adventurer with no real worries.
Ad Vitam	Attempted Suicide	
Ad Vitam	Absurdly Youthful Mother	This is now the norm in the world, rather than the exception. A notable example is when the police go to inform Mana Ritt that her son Enoch has died. Mana could still easily pass as being in her twenties and her demeanour has an almost youthful naivete.
Ad Vitam	Best Served Cold	Christa waits for her opportunity to avenge her boyfriend for over a decade. It's her personal motivation for helping the police. She's not even sure the individual is still alive.
Ad Vitam	Body Horror	Fisherman stumble across a horrific looking creature in the ocean during a news story.  It gets worse once an autopsy is performed and it's revealed be the missing Linn. Or at least it was her.
Ad Vitam	Chekhov's Gun	The gun in Darius' car.  Christa steals it to use to kill Caron.
Ad Vitam	The Determinator	Darius is world weary and likely suffering from depression but never stops trying to find the missing young people. Even with retirement looming round the corner and  even when he is forced retire before closing the case. His last moments are rescuing Christa from Odessa whilst bleeding to death.
Ad Vitam	Dramatically Missing the Point	Mana Ritt can't quite grasp the concept her son is dead. Darius explains death is no longer a common thing in most peoples lives. Later Mana calls into the police station, still in shock and still confused about the finality of it all. Eventually she does come to realise her son is not coming back  and it causes her to attempt a murder-suicide. She kills Linus but is stopped from turning the gun on herself.
Ad Vitam	Driven to Suicide	Saul's members are often suffering from depression and a host of mental health issues. Saul's members often prey upon this in others. It's implied many young people commit suicide after finding out they are among the unlucky few who are incompatible with regen. Saul just gives them false hope it means something.
Ad Vitam	Face Death with Dignity	Caron's last thoughts are one of acceptance not panic or terror.
Ad Vitam	Fantastic Slur	Linus doesn't hide his contempt for Darius, labelling the biologically immortal are just "the dead" or "ghosts." It's the sort of terminology you'd expect to be common within Saul.
Ad Vitam	Gaining the Will to Kill	Lana knows Christa has never taken a life, so she lets he know it's a tough thing to do, no matter her motives or how much she plans it. She advises Christa not to look her target of in the eye. Otherwise she'll risk not going through with it.  This was the reason Caron couldn't finish off a badly injured Linus a decade ago and instead saved him. Christa takes her advice and keeps behind Caron when marching him to the stadium field, her hand is visibly shaking, but she still shoots him in the back of the head. Lana: "A word of advice. Avoid eye contact. Or you won't be able to do it."
Ad Vitam	Glad-to-Be-Alive Sex	Christa and Lesky after witnessing the shooting of  Linus. Subverted in that it was still motivated as part of a greater plan. Though  Christa makes it clear that she wanted it due to physical attraction too.
Ad Vitam	History Repeats	The mass suicide of young people at the beach, brings to mind an infamous incident 10 years ago involving a mass suicide at a stadium. Both the media and police believe it's a possible resurgence of Saul, a suicide cult.
Ad Vitam	Hypocrite	
Ad Vitam	Instant Death Bullet	Averted with Linus who despite shooting himself point blank in the head, actually still survives. It caused partial brain damage that's strongly implied to have affected his behaviour, namely impulse control and increased aggression. He spends a full fifty minutes angrily banging on a locked door in frustration.
Ad Vitam	Love Makes You Dumb	Linus is caught trying to steal the body what is strongly implied to be someone he was in love with out of the morgue. This in of itself is a reckless move given he's a wanted man but he then manages to get stuck in the morgue until the police show up to arrest him.
Ad Vitam	Meaningful Name	
Ad Vitam	Miles to Go Before I Sleep	"I never left the stadium."
Ad Vitam	"Not So Different" Remark	Virgil is horrified when  Odessa murders one of his staff in cold blood to make sure he stays in line and to ensure no loose ends. She points out that he's in no position to judge  what with him actually being Caron and the man who got 23 other children to shoot themselves.
Ad Vitam	Older Than They Look	Discussed Trope. Most of the population look nothing like their real age. A popular ice breaker in the setting is ask what age a person is or to try and guess it.
Ad Vitam	The Plague	There was a pandemic sweeping through the world that began in North America over a century ago. Millions had died in just a few months. Darius  and his son both fell prey to it like so many others. The disease seemingly had no cure with Darius pointing out that they'd even tried chemotherapy to no avail. The invention of regen played a role in combating it. Darius was prioritised for early trials because he was a police officer and his condition in the terminal stage.
Ad Vitam	Self-Made Orphan	
Ad Vitam	"The Reason You Suck" Speech	Darius delivers one of these to Linus in his cell to try and break him for info. It gets to Linus but he still refuses to divulge any info. Darius: You think you've thought a lot about this, right? But when I've read what you've written, I just don't think you know a thing. Death to you is just an abstraction. "The other world," "the beyond," "paradise," "the heavenly realm." They're just images. When you've lived with the stench of disease, when you've felt you're own skin rotting, when you cry every time you piss, then you necessarily see things quite differently."
Ad Vitam	Rule of Symbolism	Jellyfish serve as symbol of the regen technology and as such in-universe have become a cultural symbol of eternal youth and immortality. The same species of immortal jellyfish that helped create the breakthrough of regen are even kept as social status pets.
Ad Vitam	Who Wants to Live Forever?	A major theme throughout the film and one that is discussed frequently.
A Evar Visindamadur	Katrín Lilja Sigurðardóttir	rengjugengi Háskóla Íslands ("Explosion Gang of the University of Iceland"; S1–S3):  (a chemistry professor) and a guest host perform chemistry experiments that often involve explosions, fire, and things changing color.

Adam Ruins Everything	Adaptational Attractiveness	The real Linus Pauling, who infamously promoted fake ideas about vitamins, was hardly the Casanova that the show portrays him to be.

Adam Ruins Everything	Adjacent to This Complete Breakfast	Adam debunks the alleged nutritional value of milk, orange juice, and especially breakfast cereal.
Adam Ruins Everything	Affectionate Parody	"Adam Ruins What We Learned In School" is an animated episode that's one to kids' educational TV shows, the most obvious one being The Magic School Bus. Other references include Dora the Explorer and Rocky and Bullwinklenote  Specifically Peabody's Improbable History  in the second segment, and the entire third segment is one to Schoolhouse Rock!.
Adam Ruins Everything	Badass Fingersnap	Adam (and others) can activate his powers with a snap, but due to the tone it's rarely that impressive. The most Badass example so far is probably "Adam Ruins Justice," when Rhea banishes Adam's sample jury and takes over the final act.
Adam Ruins Everything	Based on a Great Big Lie	
Adam Ruins Everything	After the End	In "The First Facts-giving," Adam explains this is why the British were able to colonize what is now the Eastern U.S. with relative ease. The episode explains that numerous Native American groups, from Meso-America (modern-day Latin America) all the way into what is now the U.S. lived in complex societies that would often include densely packed urban centers, and would regularly trade with other groups, whether they were also organized in complex societies, or were nomadic. When the Spanish took over Meso-America, brought with them numerous diseases that the Indigenous populations were not immune to. Thanks to the trade routes, disease was able to spread faster than the European settlers, thus by the time the Pilgrims arrived in Plymouth rock, over a hundred years after Cortez arrived from Spain, the local tribes had been severely decimated by sickness, and the Pilgrims assumed that, barring the occasional local, the land they were on was an empty continent waiting to be colonized.
Adam Ruins Everything	The Alleged Expert	According to a "Re-Animated History" bit about the history of anatomy, for over a thousand years, anatomists were all taught the teachings of the Ancient Greek physician Galen, with professors not even examining human bodies themselves. During the Renaissance, professor of surgery and anatomy Andreas Vesalius did his own research on actual human bodies and found that Galen had made hundreds of mistakes because he had only studied the anatomy of animals and just assumed that human bodies were similar.
Adam Ruins Everything	All-Natural Snake Oil	"Adam Ruins Malls" states that that the merchandise sold in nutritional supplement stores is dangerously under-regulated, and the ingredients don't always match what's on the label. On a slightly less worrying note, "Adam Ruins Nutrition" points out that most "natural" orange juice is made with highly processed (but harmless) packets of orange byproducts in order to extend its shelf life without losing flavor, along with a LOT of sugar.
Adam Ruins Everything	All Part of the Show	The snobby collectors in "Adam Ruins Art" assume Adam smashing one of the paintings from the inside is performance art.
Adam Ruins Everything	Alpha Bitch	An adult version appears in, funnily enough, the episode where Adam proves that alpha males don't exist. She proceeds to mentally dominate Alpha!Adam while Normal!Adam narrates that humans' closest genetic relatives are not chimps, but bonobos, which are actually matriarchal.
Adam Ruins Everything	Alternate Timeline	In "Adam Ruins Having a Baby" Emily finds out she's pregnant, so Adam shows her and Murph the misconceptions and cultural biases that people have of having a baby. At the end of the episode, Adam tells them that everything until then was a What If? scenario and tells them that at this point in history, it's perfectly okay for couples to wait as long or a bit longer than they already have, or decide not to have a child at all. They then go to the beginning of the episode where Emily is not pregnant, and she and Murph decide to wait a few years more.
Adam Ruins Everything	Aluminum Christmas Trees	In-Universe, many of the subjects that Adam covers have been forgotten by history and replaced by myth and legend. For example;
Adam Ruins Everything	Ambiguously Gay	The Reanimated History narrator mentions how handsome JFK is pretty much every other sentence.
Adam Ruins Everything	And I Must Scream	In "Adam Ruins What We Learned In School" a child is trapped in King Tutankhamen's tomb for millennia by mistake, claiming to have "learned that hell is just a word" after being alone for thousands of years when he finally escaped. This is basically glossed over.
Adam Ruins Everything	Animated Episode	When debating with a science student about the validity of test data obtained from lab mice, Adam transforms himself and the student into animated mice, a la Pinky and the Brain.
Adam Ruins Everything	Annoying Younger Sibling	Due to his immature and abrasive nature, Adam sometimes serves as this to Rhea despite being three years older than her. Likewise, Rhea comes across as a Cool Big Sis due to her maturity and competence.
Adam Ruins Everything	Arson, Murder, and Jaywalking	"Arsenic? BPAs? Little bugs?"
Adam Ruins Everything	Artistic License – Economics	Averting this trope is the whole point of Adam Ruins...the Economy. For example, the unemployment rate only counts people who are looking for work, not people who make some cash to live by until they find a steady job. The Dow Jones only measures how well the best performing companies are doing, if one of those companies is not doing so well, its replaced by another that is. Also, the promise made by politicians — that American factory workers will get their jobs back to compete with China — is impossible. Since China has so many people and is surrounded by countries that extract raw materials, they can afford to use cheap manual labor to produce so many of the goods we buy. In the U.S. however, companies manage to make a profit in their factories by using robots, and by concentrating mostly on hiring people that can provide services, instead of producing goods.
Adam Ruins Everything	Artistic License – History	A brief shot "The First Factsgiving" shows Native Americans tilling the fields with horses. Horses are not endemic to the Americas, and did not first appear until they were brought by the Spaniards.
Adam Ruins Everything	Art Shift	Quite frequently - his discussion about "Buy One, Give One" programs takes him and Emily through a TV, then to a dry-erase drawing before popping back out in the real world.
Adam Ruins Everything	Ascended Extra	After being a recurring bit character throughout the first two seasons, Uncle Sam finally gets to be the ruinee for a whole episode in "Adam Ruins America".
Adam Ruins Everything	As Long as It Sounds Foreign	In "Adam Ruins Work" the Säkkijärven Polka, a Finnish song, plays while Adam talks about German workers.
Adam Ruins Everything	Aspect Ratio Switch	In "Adam Ruins Hollywood", this happens twice. The show's default aspect ratio is 16:9, but the first shots are vertical smartphone video when Mark is showing his excitement to be at the Awardie Awards. This features a blurred and cropped version of the exact same video playing in the letterbox, similar to what some TV shows do. The second time, the frame briefly letterboxes to Cinemascope when actors in an ultraviolent movie explain that PG-13 movies have contained more violence than R movies.
Adam Ruins Everything	Asshole Victim	The positive takeaway in "Adam Ruins Shopping Malls" is that malls are dying due to oversaturation. Considering so many of them were made by abusing a loophole to use them as tax shelters as well as bastardizing Victor Gruen's original intent, it can be seen as nothing less than Karmic Death. Instead, cities are now replacing them with urban renewal projects such as outdoor town squares with local businesses, public space, and even housing which was Gruen's original intent for them.
Adam Ruins Everything	Audience Surrogate	Everyone who is not Adam, from recurring characters like Emily and Murph to the one episode characters that appear throughout the series act as this whenever a topic is explored in an episode. Adam himself is this trope whenever someone else uses his Reality Warper powers to explain something to him.
Adam Ruins Everything	Bathtub Bonding	Adam and Hayley in "Adam Ruins Hygiene," albeit without water in the tub.
Adam Ruins Everything	Benevolent Boss	Adam argues that being a good boss can actually improve productivity and benefit the economy itself. Even Henry Ford, notoriously anti-union, gave his workers more time off simply because it meant that they could buy his cars.
Adam Ruins Everything	Biting-the-Hand Humor	"Adam Ruins CollegeHumor" is about how Adam believes that CollegeHumor has been declining ever since he left as a regular cast member.
Adam Ruins Everything	Bittersweet Ending	At the end of "Adam Ruins Hygiene," Hayley finally gets out of the bathroom and goes on her date. Adam, who has clearly developed feelings for her, ends up locked back inside and alone. To top it all off, his Tamagotchi dies.
Adam Ruins Everything	Bizarre Taste in Food	Adam likes peanut butter and sardine sandwiches ("What? They're both healthy fats."). And a later episode reveals he has oatmeal with soy sauce for breakfast.
Adam Ruins Everything	Black Dude Dies First	Hayley winds up breaking her neck at the tail-end of "Adam Ruins Death," while Emily narrowly avoids it after hearing Murph, her fiancee, say that he'd planned to take her to a Ronda Rousey meet 'n greet.
Adam Ruins Everything	Black Face	Averted in "Adam Ruins Christmas." He mentions the Dutch St. Nicholas' slave, Black Peter, but his sister grabs the camera mid-pan to avoid showing him.
Adam Ruins Everything	Black Like Me	A downplayed, but very powerful variation is used in "Adam Ruins... Guns." When talking about how gun-rights activists overlook black people in their activism, Adam role plays with the white gun-rights supporter about what happened to Philando Castile. Adam "pulls him over" and asks him for his license and registration, he complies and, per the law, informs him that he is legally carrying a firearm. The cop tells him to not reach for it, "Castile" responds he isn't, the cop again orders him not to reach for it, and when "Castile" and his passenger insists he wasn't, the man's daughter-in-law yells "BANG!" and says that despite following the law that every responsible gun owner should obey, Castile was shot dead for legally carrying a gun.
Adam Ruins Everything	Bloodstained Defloration	Conversed and disparaged, with Emily Axford saying that female physical virginity is effectively non-existent, as the hymen can be torn any number of ways, and it is not uncommon for it to heal.
Adam Ruins Everything	Blue-and-Orange Morality	In "Adam Ruins Voting," the Purple Party believes that all guns are gay and that babies should be required by law to vape. Meanwhile, the Yellow Party believes that all gays should own guns and that all people named "Trevor" should be executed.
Adam Ruins Everything	Boring, but Practical	According to Adam Ruins... Science, any scientific research that does not fit the criteria of being personally appealing to corporate funders or the government, does not get funded, even if it may have practical uses for society and humanity at large.
Adam Ruins Everything	Borrowed Catchphrase	In "Adam Ruins Taxes," Barack Obama and Ronald Reagan both appear to say they support return free filingnote The government calculates how much the citizens owe in taxes, shaking their hands and sayingReagan: Yes we can!Obama: Tear down this wall.. of paperwork!
Adam Ruins Everything	"Both Sides Have a Point" Remark	Subverted in "Adam Ruins Guns," where the outcome is essentially, neither side has a point. The episode revolves around Adam interrupting a Thanksgiving dinner and telling a gun-safety advocate and her gun-rights father about how they over generalize their respective side of the argument. He tells the gun-safety woman that simply banning guns in the U.S. would not work because of the hundreds of millions of guns in circulation, and a national gun-buy back, like what was done in Australia following the Port Arthur massacre, would be too expensive to carry out (imagine buying hundreds of millions of guns at their original price), and groups like the N.R.A. help build a sense of camaraderie for gun lovers. Adam then tells the gun-rights father that the N.R.A. was not always about universal gun rights, and even was instrumental in writing some early gun-control measures, including taking away guns from irresponsible owners and denying the sale outright of anyone who is deemed irresponsible, however in the 1970s new leaders in the N.R.A. began lobbying for universal gun ownership and the repeal of gun-control measures that they deemed too restrictive. When the daughter's African American wife goes to a store to get away from their arguing, Adam enlists her help to show that gun control was used to keep minorities unarmed, Ronald Regan, when he was governor of California, enacted gun control measures to disarm groups like the Black Panthers, and stop and frisk laws disproportionately target minority neighborhoods. Also, she tells her father in law that gun rights are essentially for "whites only," citing the case of Marissa Alexander who after firing a warning shot at her abusive ex-husband, was arrested for reckless gun use, and despite citing Florida's "stand your ground" lawnote the gist of the law states that if a person feels that their life is in danger, then using deadly force is justifiable, and can result in being acquitted of any wrong doing due to self defense, she was given a twenty year sentence. She also mentions Philando Castile, who despite following the law that every responsible gun owner should obey, he informed the police officer who pulled him over he had a registered firearm in his vehicle, Castille was shot and killed when the police officer made the (incorrect) assumption that Castille was going to use the gun against him.
Adam Ruins Everything	Bottle Episode	"Adam Ruins Hygiene" plays out in Hayley's bathroom, except for an excursion into the Absurdly Spacious Sewer.
Adam Ruins Everything	Bowdlerise	Things such as strong language are removed from the original College Humor shorts.
Adam Ruins Everything	Bread, Eggs, Milk, Squick	The uses for the Internet seen in the cafe in "Adam Ruins the Internet" include staying in touch with friends, discussing important issues with colleagues, and harassing children.
Adam Ruins Everything	Breather Episode	"Adam Ruins Hollywood", a lighthearted exploration of fairly innocuous misconceptions about Hollywood which aired following the shockingly dark "Adam Ruins Death".
Adam Ruins Everything	Bribing Your Way to Victory	A segment in "Adam Ruins Hollywood" shows how entertainment awards (Oscars, Emmys, Golden Globes, etc.) are essentially this.
Adam Ruins Everything	Broken Aesop	
Adam Ruins Everything	Butt-Monkey	Ronald in "Adam Ruins What We Learned in School" who is an Expy of Arnold from The Magic School Bus. At the beginning of the episode, when Ms. Dazzle is sending out subjects the class will be learning in school, he's thrown a tennis ball with "Vietnam War" on it and nervously (and quickly) says that he got the ball that says "Grammar" on it. It goes on from there. When Christopher Columbus begins slaughtering the natives, Ms. Dazzle covers the eyes of the two other children, leaving Ronald to see the violence with regret. Then, when the class visits ancient Egypt, Ronald doesn't make it into the time machine and is forced wait thousands of years for the tomb to open again. The lesson he learned from that experience is that "Hell is just a word". The episode ends with him vomiting endless beetles from his mouth due to the mummy's curse.
Adam Ruins Everything	Call-Back	
Adam Ruins Everything	The Cameo	"Adam Ruins Christmas" is narrated by Adam Savage.Closing Narration: That Christmas, Rhea learned her big brother wasn’t such a big bother, after all. And that emotionally stunted man taught us that the meaning of Christmas is whatever the (bleep) we want it to be. I guess smug men named Adam really can solve all the world’s problems. Another Christmas myth: broken.
Adam Ruins Everything	Capitalism Is Bad	You could make a drinking game out of how many times the myths or misconceptions is caused by someone making money off of it, whether it be a global monopoly, ad campaigns or lobbyism.
Adam Ruins Everything	Cessation of Existence	At the beginning of "Adam Ruins Death," Adam equates death with non-existence. That some (or even many) of his viewers might believe in some form of life after death is not once mentioned. The only time the episode comes close is when one of the experts asks Emily if she has any strongly held values or beliefs that might influence her medical wishes.
Adam Ruins Everything	Cerebus Syndrome	"Adam Ruins Death," full stop. The usual comedic tone was ditched in favor of one of the most depressing things you will ever see on TV. The Downer Ending doesn't help matters.
Adam Ruins Everything	Character Catchphrase	Adam has "Actually..." and "Hi, I'm Adam Conover, and this is Adam Ruins Everything."
Adam Ruins Everything	Character Development	Since a number of CollegeHumor actors are recurring as the same characters, we get to see their relationships with Adam develop. It's also been very strongly implied that Adam is desperate to make friends, because he's an annoying know-it-all no one likes.
Adam Ruins Everything	Chirping Crickets	
Adam Ruins Everything	Cloneopoly	In the episode "Adam Ruins: The Suburbs," when Adam explains to Ron how the suburbs are a symbol of modern day segregation, he pulls out a game called "Settlers of Suburbia: Red Lining Edition." Adam explains that during The Great Depression, the F.D.R. administration set up programs to help people get loans to save their homes, and to determine who got those loans, cities were red lined. Ron's son, little Donovan gets the green zone part of the board, representing white neighborhoods, and Ron got the red zone representing minority neighborhoods. Every time little Donovan rolled the dice, he got rewarded with community chest-like cards, and built bigger and better lodgings for his little figure, Ron on the other hand got punished by the community chest-like cards, and built nothing on his side of the board. And just as Ron was not allowed to go into the green zone of the game board, Adam explains that the Federal government allowed suburban developers to enforce racial segregation.

Adam Ruins Everything	Curse of The Ancients	Literal example. In the early 20th century, the "jay" in "jaywalking" used to be an N-word-level obscene slur meaning "dirty hillbilly" AKA "moron who jumped in front of a car." Car companies and proponents purposely created the term to put the blame for vehicular deaths on the victims themselves, as many cities were so dismayed by the daily incidents they were about to ban cars altogether. As a result, people were banned from streets instead.

Adam Ruins Everything	Desecrating the Dead	In "Adam Ruins... What we Learned in School," Adam tells Ms. Dazzle that Tutankamun was one of the least historically important pharaohs in Ancient Egypt, and he was not the reason Egyptology took off. The Pharaohs' tombs had been periodically robbed through the centuries, but when Napoleon occupied Egypt he brought a number of treasures with him, setting a frenzy among wealthy Europeans that resulted in the mass looting of innumerable historical artifacts, including mummies, which were unwrapped as part of an upper-class party game, and mummified remains were often ingested with no respect to the deceased. The only reason Tutankamun became so well known is that his tomb had been so overlooked by robbers (including European expeditions through the 1800's), that when it was "discovered" in the 1920's it too was looted by Europeans.

Adam Ruins Everything	Double Standard	A non-gender version is discussed in "Adam Ruins... Guns." The episode revolves around a white father and his white daughter arguing about guns, and it gets to the point where the daughter's African-American wife runs out to get away from their arguing. When they catch up to her, she and Adam explain to her wife that gun control was set up to help white people feel safe, with law enforcement explicitly targeting minority neighborhoods, citing New York City's "stop and frisk" issue, in which the NYPD would stop a random black person for no good reason and check them for weapons and drugs. Feeling smug, her father then says that's proof enough that gun control is stupid, but his daughter-in-law then says that in practice, gun rights are basically whites only, citing the case of Marissa Alexander, who got arrested for firing a warning shot at her abusive husband and, despite citing Florida's "stand your ground" lawnote the gist of the law states that if a person feels that their life is in danger, then using deadly force is justifiable, and can result in being acquitted of any wrong doing due to self defense, was given a 20-year sentence. She also mentions the case of Philando Castile, who was pulled over and despite following the law, to inform a police officer that he is legally carrying a firearm, was shot for carrying a firearm.
Adam Ruins Everything	Downer Ending	
Adam Ruins Everything	Drugs Are Bad	"Adam Ruins Drugs" shows this is Based on a Great Big Lie; marijuana is perfectly safe(as long as your brain isn't developing AKA over 25), but was smeared as an ultra-lethal violence-stimulant solely to support a variation on Prohibition. Heroin wasn't much of an issue until Nixon used it as an excuse to suppress his critics in the Black community. D.A.R.E. actually increased drug use by acting as free advertising for drugs - and D.A.R.E. actually suppressed all studies that showed this. The War on Drugs created a multi-billion-dollar drug market that employs more people than Silicon Valley, and refined them to be far more potent and cheaper than fast food - while causing drug-related deaths to skyrocket. And perfectly legal drugs benefited from that research as well, to the point that meth addicts can't tell meth from Adderall.
Adam Ruins Everything	Eagleland Osmosis	In the episode "100 Years Ago Today," when Adam talks about the Panama Canal, he agrees with the Narrator that the Canal was indeed an engineering marvel, but its construction was incredibly brutal. Adam mentions that the (white) American workers sent in to oversee the construction were housed in clean U.S. style neighborhoods, paid relatively well, and allowed to shop in stores that catered to their tastes. The (black) Caribbean laborers were expected to toil heavily in the canal's construction, were restricted in living inside shanty towns, were paid poorly, and had to shop for their sustenance in poorly stocked shops. When hearing this, the Narrator asks if Adam was referring to, and Adam exclaims that the Americans did in fact institute a Jim Crow-style system of segregation in Panama.

Adam Ruins Everything	Expensive Glass of Crap	In one episode, Adam does a segment debunking wine tasting. He cites multiple studies in which "experts" were asked to tell the difference between red wine and dyed white wine or cheap wine and expensive wine. The experts failed to do so, often rating cheap wines poured into expensively labeled decanters higher than expensive wines poured into cheaper labeled bottles. The sommelier character introduced for the segment is actually ecstatic when he hears this and starts happily guzzling a cheap box wine. Adam concludes that it's best to simply drink the wine(s) you like best and not let the opinions of others sway your decision.
Adam Ruins Everything	Explain, Explain... Oh, Crap!	The ruinee in Adam Ruins Science turns out to be a fan of the show, so Adam offers to let her do the intro:Winnie: Hi! I'm Winnie Jones, and this is Adam Conover, and I'm on Adam Ruins Everything! [beat] Uh-oh...
Adam Ruins Everything	Expy Coexistence	In "Adam Ruins Tech", CORI is introduced as a Bland-Name Product version of Amazon Alexa. Later in the episode, CORI mentions that she was created to compete with Alexa.
Adam Ruins Everything	Failure Is the Only Option	"Adam Ruins Prison" shows that thanks to things like Privately Owned prisons getting money from having prisoners, some even being able to sue states if they are not at 100% capacity, and the "Tough On Crime" movement removing almost all education programs, it's damn near impossible for a prisoner to rehabilitate. Then there is the fact that when a prisoner does get out they are given a mountain of debt, and then it's made almost impossible for them to get a job thanks to the "Have you committed a felony?" box on applications.
Adam Ruins Everything	Hollywood Heart Attack	Parodied. Tony illustrates the problems with canned goods, namely the high sodium giving people high blood pressure, by throwing an epic flailing fit culminating in his heart bloodily bursting out of his chest after a single sip of soup.Adam: Well, that's an exaggeration. Your heart wouldn't literally explode. Great work, Tony. [Tony gives a thumbs-up]
Adam Ruins Everything	Fake Charity	In "Adam Ruins... Doing Good," the final memory revisited by Adam and Mr. Hulko, owner of the Hulko Corporation explains that charity organizations set by billionaires like him are this. Adam demonstrates that billionaires will set up their charity drives, and fund them with their own money, however, if a billionaire's company is having money problems, or if they need some quick cash for a personal expense, then they will dip into the charity. Also, the money that billionaires lobby the government to let them keep by cutting the tax rate could be used to fund programs that their organizations are supposed to help with.
Adam Ruins Everything	Fingerprinting Air	A debated element of "Adam Ruins Forensic Science" - though the AFIS program does have similarity to fictional representations of fingerprint analysis, it can't be used in the majority of cases because the majority of fingerprints found at crime scenes are smudged and/or incomplete, making computer analysis extremely difficult. In such cases lab technicians usually get multiple AFIS matches, and start guessing.

Adam Ruins Everything	Frivolous Lawsuit	"Adam Ruins Justice" deconstructs the "old lady vs. McDonald's" lawsuit by pointing out that the coffee she spilled on herself had been boiling, inflicting third-degree burns. And it also was not an isolated case; the company demanded the machines be run at the highest temperatures possible so it could be brewed faster and thus sold more, meaning over 700 other people had been scalded. What's more, she had originally been trying to settle out of court, asking only for enough to cover her extensive medical bills, and was even found to be partially at fault when the case did go to court. The jury actually were the ones who awarded her the huge amount in punitive damages because they were outraged over what happened, which the judge reduced by three fourths. After the lawsuit was settled, McDonald's lawyers spread rumors that she was nothing but a greedy old lady just trying to get money from someone with deep pockets.
Adam Ruins Everything	Funny Background Event	
Adam Ruins Everything	Gamer Chick	Discussed in "Adam Ruins Summer Fun". Adam's argument is that games actually started as gender-neutral, and women even contributed to the industry. However, a side effect of the The Great Video Game Crash of 1983 was that video games started getting marketed to boys because toy sections in stores were (and still are) split between boys and girls, and games were places in the boy sections (really, could've easily been the other way around), hence why it's seen as masculine. Girls statistically enjoy video games just as much as boys, they just feel excluded from the culture. Adam also admonishes the boy for looking down on the "stupid phone games" that many women play. As far as Adam is concerned, "games are games".
Adam Ruins Everything	Geeky Turn-On	At the end of "Adam Ruins Restaurants," Adam spots a "shooting star" that passes above them as they're eating ice cream.

Adam Ruins Everything	Go Mad from the Isolation	Emily gets a lesson on this in "Adam Ruins Prison", more specifically about how solitary confinement can cause prisoners to suffer delirium. To drive the point home, she hallucinates the whole lecture in solitary while the real Adam has a nice chat with her cellmate.

Adam Ruins Everything	Historical Hero Upgrade	Ironically, in "An Ancient History of Violence'', Adam's presentation of a number of major historical figures and groups who had well recorded ruthless streaks emphasizes their more positive contributions.
Adam Ruins Everything	Historical Villain Upgrade	If a famous or historical figure puts in an appearance, you can usually expect Adam to give them the shabby treatment, especially if they have otherwise high standing in American culture.
Adam Ruins Everything	N-Word Privileges	Apparently only cats can use the word "pussy" as an insult.
Adam Ruins Everything	Honest John's Dealership	Adam has a tendency to explain certain industries as if they were these, including the Car dealership industry, the funeral industry, the wedding industry, and the egg-freezing industry, all of whom take on naive customers and extort money out of them for services they may not want. For example, the egg-freezing industry taking on clients that are 20 - 30 years old who are worried about infertility, and are more than willing to pay through the nose to freeze eggs that they may never even use, despite egg-freezing being geared towards chemotherapy patients, not the average healthy person.
Adam Ruins Everything	Hooker with a Heart of Gold	In "Adam Ruins the Wild West", Adam lists several brothel madams who not only played a substantial part in forming towns in the old West, but used the profits from their businesses to fund local charities, such as Laura Evans, who provided workers' compensation for injured men and shelter for victims of domestic abuse, and Diamond Jessie Hayman, who provided food and clothing for victims of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.
Adam Ruins Everything	Hostile Show Takeover

Adam Ruins Everything	Humans Are Flawed	The episode "Emily Ruins Adam", which deconstructed the show itself, points out that, even when presented with logical evidence against their previous convictions, people might respond by rejecting it and perceiving it as a personal attack rather than helpful advice, (known as "the Backfire Effect"):Emily: Fact is, humans just aren't that logical. We're complex, biased, emotional creatures. If you really want to change peoples' minds, you have to accept that.
Adam Ruins Everything	Hypochondria	Rachel in "Adam Ruins the Hospital" clearly falls into this trope. She's been to the hospital ten times in a short period of time.

Adam Ruins Everything	Ignored Epiphany	
Adam Ruins Everything	Ignored Expert	In "Adam Ruins Weight Loss," he explains that John Yudkin warned that it was the rise of sugar consumption that was leading to the prevalence of heart disease and obesity in the modern era, but he was ignored by the public, mocked by the mainstream scientific community that had been paid by the sugar industry to declare fat the culprit, and he died in obscurity.
Adam Ruins Everything	I Just Want to Have Friends	Abrasive as he is, Adam's character is shown to be pretty lonely. He just can't seem to stop spouting uncomfortable facts.
Adam Ruins Everything	Immortality Immorality	"Adam Ruins Death" takes an interesting spin on it. The quest for immortality is not only an impossible one, but several attempts throughout history have ended badly for everyone involved (A Chinese Emperor who drank Mercury poisoned himself, a Chinese alchemist accidentally invented gunpowder, cryogenically frozen people are unlikely to be revived in the future [assuming the company keeping them frozen doesn't lose their bodies or go bankrupt and let them rot], and transferring your intelligence to a computer is more akin to cloning than immortality).
Adam Ruins Everything	Insane Troll Logic	The show lampshades some of the pretty weird logic behind current cultural icons. Like how one scientistnote Linus Pauling, a double Nobel Laureate, who had a brilliant career until he went off the deep end and... claimed that vitamins could cure cancer. Or how Kellogg's corn flakes and the Graham cracker were invented to be as bland as possible in order to suppress lustful instincts. Makes Just as Much Sense in Context.
Adam Ruins Everything	Insufferable Genius	The whole point of Adam's character is to harass people with the truth, even when the truth is pretty horrific.
Adam Ruins Everything	The Internet Is an Ocean	"Adam Ruins The Internet" depicts it this way. Adam takes his subject on a rowboat into a cyberspace ocean and literally "fishes" for people's information.
Adam Ruins Everything	Jerkass	Adam's character occasionally strays into this, particularly when he's very obviously intruding on private moments.
Adam Ruins Everything	Jerkass Has a Point

Adam Ruins Everything	Know-Nothing Know-It-All	Sometimes Adam confronts a person like this. Like the man lamenting technology in "Adam Ruins the Internet".

Adam Ruins Everything	Later-Installment Weirdness	There are a lot more story arcs in the first half of season 2 compared to the rest of the show.
Adam Ruins Everything	Le Film Artistique	In Adam Ruins... the Internet, when Adam tells the Audience Surrogate about how woefully behind the U.S. is in terms of internet access, his mentioning of how the French system is more efficient than that of the US has the actors representing the internet providers, and the French government hold somber conversation with thick French accents, in black and white, and smoking cigarettes.
Adam Ruins Everything	Lesser of Two Evils	In "Why Trophy Hunting Can Be Good for Animals", Adam argues that game-hunting is this under specific circumstances. While the animal lover he lectures doesn't like game-hunting, the revenue generated from the sale of hunting licenses funds conservation projects and law enforcement to protect animals and their habitats from poaching and human settlement. In other words, the death of a few animals from trophy hunting is saving entire species from extinction.
Adam Ruins Everything	Lie Detector	In "Adam Ruins Forensic Science," Adam debunks the myth that polygraphs are anything other than machines that detect, pretty much, whatever they feel like. He even points out that, in one case, a polygraph worked on a plant. Even the machine's creator decried its use as a reliable method. The episode also points out that known serial killers took polygraph tests when they were investigated as suspects and passed them, and shows how often they still get presented as accurate on TV. However, one of the detectives then reveals that they know that lie detectors don't work, but they use them to Perp Sweat suspects into confessing. Unfortunately, all this is an Engineered Public Confession to the audience.
Adam Ruins Everything	Lighter and Softer	Adam in the TruTV series is a lot nicer than he was in the CollegeHumor shorts the series is based off of, and the jokes less crude. Each episode also makes a point to add a positive take away after all the ruining is done.
Adam Ruins Everything	Look Both Ways	In "Adam Ruins Cars," Adam points out that cars were only invented a century ago, and people used to walk in the streets all the time. Streets became cars-only after a massive campaign shifted all the blame for pedestrian deaths onto "Jaywalkers."
Adam Ruins Everything	LOL, 69	A running joke is for whenever a scientist or worker writes down a number, they contemplate adding in 69, but exclaim that it's too silly, even for them.
Adam Ruins Everything	Loser Protagonist	While Adam is usually portrayed as in the right for lecturing others about what is and isn't socially acceptable, there are times where he's an outcast because of his holier-than-thou attitude.
Adam Ruins Everything	Magical Realism	While the show is, for the most part, grounded in reality and hard scientific fact, within the show's universe, Adam has "special TV powers" that he uses "for learning", which gives him the ability to do things like miniaturize himself and others, teleport, and bring in experts through convoluted and often surreal avenues. It's shown that others (such as Emily and Rhea) can also gain the same magical TV powers if they have something of their own to ruin. However, the powers are basically a means to an end and outside of the ruining portion of the episode, the show's setting is basically pretty mundane - Adam is a comedian, Emily is a school teacher who lives in the suburbs, Rhea is an overworked public defender, and so on.
Adam Ruins Everything	Manchild	Downplayed but Adam tends to become petulant and somewhat immature when interacting with his family.
Adam Ruins Everything	Mandatory Motherhood	Subverted in "Adam Ruins Having A Baby", Emily and Murph say they were always told this. Adam explains to them that, while this is true for some, it doesn't have to be for everyone.

Adam Ruins Everything	Metafictional Horror	In the episode "Adam Ruins Nutrition", Adam takes Dr. Todd into a commercial for the fictional cereal "Honey Toasted Crunchies" in order to explain why most foods Americans think of as part of a balanced breakfast are unhealthy (or at least have bizarre histories, in the case of Kellog's cereal). Todd and Adam are aware they're in a commercial, and the segment ends with Adam saying that the family in the commercial isn't real, which causes them to fade away with an unsettling sound effect, before the announcer comes back in.
Adam Ruins Everything	Mirror Scare	The way Adam appears in the bathroom mirror in the opening of "Adam Ruins Hygiene."
Adam Ruins Everything	Moment Killer	Adam loves doing this, frequently not even realizing he's doing it.
Adam Ruins Everything	Mood Whiplash	The emotional tone of "Adam Ruins Having a Baby" changes immediately after Emily is delivered a "gift" from a Delivery Stork: POST-PARTUM DEPRESSION!
Adam Ruins Everything	Moon-Landing Hoax	"Adam Ruins Conspiracy Theories" has a "re-creation" of the "set" (where the director is obviously Stanley Kubrick). The expert brought in explains that it was technologically impossible to stage the moon landing, using the fact that all the shadows in official pictures are completely parallel to each other, as there was only one single light source located 93 million miles away. Shadows produced by lighting in a sound stage would be conical from one point of origin, and the only way to replicate the same effect as the sun would be to use millions of lasers that could only be produced individually through huge bulky machines, and they could only be red lasers back in the 1960s. They also point out the fact that they would've had to prevent 400,000 NASA employees from talking about it, and that the broadcast was picked up in numerous countries across the planet, including the Soviet Union, who would've done anything in their power to prove it was faked just to stop from being one-upped by their Cold War enemies.
Adam Ruins Everything	Moral Guardians	"Adam Ruins Hollywood" shows that movie ratings are decided by Moral Guardians who find sex more objectionable than violence and give movies with the tiniest amount of sex more mature ratings than movies filled with violence. Doubly so for LGBT characters.
Adam Ruins Everything	Most Gamers Are Male	Adam explains how this perception came to be (gaming companies choosing to market to boys after re-branding consoles as toys due to the boy/girl aisle split in stores). When his Audience Surrogate points out that this is just "stupid phone games," Adam's reaction is "Uh, so? Games are games." He explains that the main reason women avoid certain games is simply that they're designed and marketed for men (i.e. the video game industry seems to be ignoring half the population of potential consumers out of sheer habit).
Adam Ruins Everything	Mr. Fanservice	In-universe Dr. Todd Bodd (a Dr. Oz expy) whose real name is Rod has his body regularly complimented, ogled and groped by his female audience. He mentions at one point a former job as a stripper.
Adam Ruins Everything	My Biological Clock Is Ticking	When Emily has a pregnancy scare, she says this, starting the episode. Adam explains to her and Murph that the idea that you have to have children by 35 came from a 400-year-old French census. He also ends the episode reminding them that they don't have children at all if they don't want to.
Adam Ruins Everything	My Country 'Tis of Thee That I Sting	One would be hard-pressed to find a point where the United States government (personified in the form of Uncle Sam) isn't consistently portrayed as self-serving and greedy.
Adam Ruins Everything	Naked on Arrival	
Adam Ruins Everything	Nerds Are Virgins	In "Adam Ruins... What We Learned in School," when he explains how Ancient Egypt was fetishized when the treasure of Tutankhamun was showcased in the 1970s', a guy climbs onto a statue, kisses and fondles it lovingly. The Ralphie/Carlos Expy asks if that what sex is like, to which Adam responds: "I'm not sure, but I hope not."
Adam Ruins Everything	Newer Than They Think	A major running theme In-Universe is the fact that many traditions or ideas that are treated as timeless are usually pretty recent, and often the result of ad campaigns or rather ugly fads, including the war on drugs, diamond rings, summer vacation, dog breeds, mouthwash, and the idea of not walking in the street.
Adam Ruins Everything	New Media Are Evil	Mocked in "Adam Ruins Internet", where Adam not only shreds the notion that Internet has isolated people, but that people in the old days thought books, and even written language were harmful to the mind when they were both created.
Adam Ruins Everything	Nightmare Fuel Station Attendant	Adam sees absolutely nothing wrong about having a sing-along with mutant sewer creatures, or summoning a headless creature with a Belly Mouth to illustrate his "listen to your body" Aesop.
Adam Ruins Everything	No Celebrities Were Harmed	Dr. Todd Bodd is clearly a stand-in for Dr. Oz. Though he's portrayed surprisingly sympathetically; although the advice he gives on his show is useless pseudoscience, he genuinely wants to help people and isn't intentionally misleading his audience — he's just not very diligent when it comes to fact-checking. When Adam exposes how poorly researched his show is, he's just as surprised as the studio audience.
Adam Ruins Everything	No Fourth Wall	Everyone knows they're on a cable show, and that Adam has Reality Warper powers because he's the host. He's even been interrupted by the crew occasionally.
Adam Ruins Everything	Noodle Incident	It's mentioned in "Adam Ruins His Vacation" how both Adam and Melinda have seen a significant other die on the first date. This is a Continuity Nod to "Adam Ruins Death," but the story of Melinda's dead date goes unexplained.
Adam Ruins Everything	Not Helping Your Case	In Adam Ruins... the Suburbs, when Adam points out that the suburbs are a modern example of racial segregation, this exchange happens:Ron: It's not so white here, look... [camera focuses out the window, sees neighbor practicing his golf swing] Okay, bad example; [camera pans to the side] ignore the doggy sweater couple; [camera pans again] A tote bag full of kale? You're killing me, lady!
Adam Ruins Everything	The Not-Love Interest	After Adam, Emily is the most common reoccurring character on the show, and has grown steadily closer to Adam over the course of the series. However, the relationship between Emily and Adam is completely platonic, with each having their own love interests over the course of the series, and it is explicitly stated that they regard each other as a friend more than anything else.
Adam Ruins Everything	"Not Making This Up" Disclaimer	
Adam Ruins Everything	"Not So Different" Remark	Adam uses this trope to condemn both sides of the American Gun Politics debate for centering said discussion on the rights, safety, and interests of White Americans, and failing the African-American community. Namely, he pointed that both gun rights laws (e.g., conceal and carry, stand your ground) and gun control laws (e.g., stop and frisk) have not only resulted in racial profiling and mass incarceration of African-Americans, regardless of the politics of the individual states (e.g., historically liberal, pro-gun control California and more conservative, pro-gun rights Florida), but have left African-Americans more vulnerable to gun violence. Adam also called out both sides for enacting laws and policies that violated their own principles when it came to the issue of whether the Second Amendment applied to African-Americans, by pointing out that then-governor of California (and NRA member) Ronald Reagan enacted gun control laws to crack down on the Black Panthers, and that the New York Police Department - whose jurisdiction is the vauntedly liberal New York City - enforced "stop and frisk" policies that targeted African-Americans for decades.
Adam Ruins Everything	One Dose Fits All	A variation was mentioned in Adam Ruins... Science. In the episode, Adam tells the science student that a drug was developed that cured cancer in mice.

Adam Ruins Everything	Out-of-Genre Experience	The entire "Adam Ruins Death" episode.

Adam Ruins Everything	The Plague	In "Adam Ruins Sex," Adam explains that herpes is hardly the dangerous STD the media claims it is. In fact, 90% of people have it, and most show no symptoms whatsoever. It just happened to be swept up during the heightening of HIV awareness a few decades ago.
Adam Ruins Everything	Pointy-Haired Boss	In "Adam Ruins Work," Adam applies for a job and gets hired, only to immediately start pointing out how his new boss is actually bad at his job. Strangely, this doesn't get him fired. At the end of the episode, Adam convinces the boss to try to effect changes, only to get shut down by the boss's higher-ups, who pointedly ignore the same revelations.

Adam Ruins Everything	Self-Deprecation	In "Adam Ruins Hollywood," he admits that though he really is an obnoxious know-it-all in real life, there's no way one person could learn all the obscure facts he rattles off the top of his head all by themselves. He introduces his team of researchers and writers, admits that half of the time he just reads the lines they wrote, accepts a script page from one..."I'm dumb, Travis is great." Come on, man.note Of course, he's so absurdly meta at this point that "come on, man" was also scripted.
Adam Ruins Everything	Police Are Useless	Police Brutality: The episode "Adam Ruins... Cops" is all about this. For starters, Adam states that although the role of SWAT teams is to detain dangerous criminals, they are usually deployed to arrest people who have committed mundane crimes or have been called in as a joke that have turned deadly, and often assault and destroy the wrong home. He also states that, although there have been a few rare cases where a campus officer has stopped a shooter, putting officers in school almost always makes them even more dangerous since these officers are trained to deal with dangerous criminals, not misbehaving children, so they often use the same heavy handed tactics and create the "school to prison pipeline," since children who got in trouble with a campus officer have a record that labels them a criminal. Finally, even though Adam states that there are a large number of officers that put their lives on the line to keep people safe, police officers actually have no legal obligation to respond to calls for help, and to keep the illusion that police keep communities safe, cities sacrifice a large part of their social safety net budgets to provide police departments with military hardware.
Adam Ruins Everything	Politically Correct History	For the most part, the show actively defies this trope. Adam spends much of the show discussing how things most people think of as normal were actually the result of racism and/or sexism. For example, in "Adam Ruins Voting," with Adam explaining how misogyny, racism, and corruption have been part of the electoral process from its beginnings in the 1790s (and are still a problem, even though things have gotten somewhat better). The woman he lectures is shocked to see how racist the Founding Fathers were.

Adam Ruins Everything	Poverty Porn	Both Discussed and Deconstructed when Emily is quick to understand the good intentions of "Buy One, Give One" companies, in which Adam appropriately points out the flaws. She also demonstrates how she's a typical victim of "poverty porn" as she describes to Adam how she pictures that would-be less-fortunate African and her visual interpretation is so stereotypical yet crass and offensive that she stops in the middle of it, realizing its "condescending" implications.
Adam Ruins Everything	Pragmatic Villainy	In "Adam Ruins Work", Adam discusses how Henry Ford helped to create the two-day weekend, despite his hatred for the two main groups pushing for the change (Jews and union workers), because it meant employees had more time to buy his stuff.

Adam Ruins Everything	Public Domain	Discussed in "Adam Ruins Summer Fun" — due to the Walt Disney Company's lobbying to keep characters and works of theirs from falling into this so that it can still exclusively profit off of them, the length of time for all copyrighted works to enter the public domain has significantly grown in recent decades. Adam points out not only the limitations this puts on creators of newer works, researchers, etc., but also the sad hypocrisy that many of the Walt Disney Company's most beloved works were, and continue to be, adapted from public domain material.
Adam Ruins Everything	Puff of Logic	In "Adam Ruins Nutrition," when Adam tells the family in the commercial for Honey Toasted Crunchies that they are indeed, a commercial family, the husband promptly says who he works for ...which causes his family to McFly out of existence.Husband: No, I work at... Office?
Adam Ruins Everything	Reality Warper	It's Adam's show, so he can pretty much do anything to illustrate his point. Time travel and Medium Blending are pretty common. Turns out anyone who knows more than the Audience, or Adam, on a subject can do it. This is frequently lampshaded. Adam himself has been called a "magic man" many times in various languages.Melinda: Man, these powers are cool! It's fun being the Adam!
Adam Ruins Everything	Reconstruction	Occasionally, the show will point out that questioning things, while annoying, is a very important skill to have.

While Emily in turn ruins something for Adam, she acknowledges that it was probably best for her to learn the truth.
Adam Ruins Everything	Regime Change	In Adam Ruins His Vacation, when he and his girlfriend go to Hawaii, he mentions that Hawaii was for a long time an independent nation with a relatively advanced society, ruled by Queen Liliuokalani, until the end of the 19th century when some American sugar and fruit company executives, backed by the U.S. Navy and Marines, decided that they did not like how Liliuokalani was ruling and took over.

Anyone, who claims different, hasn't kept up with the changes in the economy over the last few decades. Even those successful "dropout" stories ignore that most of those who did it were already successful before dropping out. Also, in the case of Bill Gates — the most famous example — he already had thousands of hours of programming experience before going to college, and he didn't so much dropout as go on a break.

Adam spends the rest of the episode debunking three common misconceptions about the topic held by the ruinee, at one point bringing in a special guest who is an expert on the topic and enters the scene in a silly way appropriate to the topic, while the ruinee becomes increasingly frustrated until they hit a Heroic BSoD, at which point Adam brings them out of it with a "positive takeaway". Lampshaded in "Adam Ruins Science":Adam: Winnie, wait! I thought you knew the structure of my show!

Adam Ruins Everything	Tap on the Head	A key element of "Adam Ruins Football" - It's not just the big impacts that cause injury, but a large number of impacts that don't even bruise will cumulatively cause a Death of a Thousand Cuts.

Guns" centers on Adam dispelling the misconceptions of a gun pro-gun rights father and his pro-gun control daughter have getting ready to eat their Thanksgiving turkey dinner.

Adam Ruins Everything	True Art Is Angsty	Invoked. The ruinee in "Adam Ruins Art" believes this, thinking that Vincent van Gogh cut of his ear as a sign of what a mad, tortured artist he was.

Adam Ruins Everything	Truth in Television	In "Adam Ruins Weddings", Emily and Murph get married; in real life, Emily Axford and Brian Murphy are married.
Adam Ruins Everything	Ungrateful Bastard	The episode "Adam Ruins... Technology" paints the tech industry like this. Adam claims that the U.S. government invested several billion dollars worth of taxpayer money in loans and grants to companies like Google, Tesla, and Facebook with the intent of helping expand the economy and improve the world.

Adam Ruins Everything	Unusually Uninteresting Sight	Every episode after the first has the ruinees not questioning Adam's magic powers. Justified, as these are apparently a standard part of hosting a TV show in-universe.
Adam Ruins Everything	Urban Segregation	In Adam Ruins... the Suburbs, its explained that this is the reason why the suburbs are predominantly white. In the early 20th century, neighborhoods were split into "Red" and "Green" zones. "Green" zones, which were predominantly white, laws were set up to allow residents to easily get loans from banks to buy a house or start a business. "Red" zones, where ethnic minorities tended to live, it was very difficult to get a loan. Moving from a "Red" zone place to a "Green" zone was almost impossible since the government encouraged developers, and real estate agents to institute "Whites Only" house buying policies. Even when racial segregation was made illegal, white people, who for generations had benefited from "Green" and "Red" zone policies, had amassed enough capital to easily move from the city to suburbs, leaving ethnic minorities to deal with the consequences of living in a place that for such a long time lacked civic investment.
Adam Ruins Everything	Villainous Breakdown	The boss in "Adam Ruins Work" has a meltdown right before learning his Aesop.
Adam Ruins Everything	Virginity Flag	As Emily explains, there is no reliable way to tell if a woman is a virgin, since a sizable percentage of sexually-active women have intact hymens, and the hymen can be torn from any number of activities, such as horse-riding and doing splits. And it's not uncommon for it to heal. In fact, the concept of physical virginity is false, even though it's used in a number of cultures. It's also entirely possible to have sex without tearing the hymen. The main reason it's torn is from inexperience.
Adam Ruins Everything	Waiting Skeleton	In Adam Ruins Prison, when Adam is discussing the long wait for prison education programs, the camera shows a line of people. The head of that line is a skeleton.

A Night Out", after Emily and Adam ruin a night out with "Becks", Emily's friend from college, they talk about how they have very little in common and even admit to not knowing why they were friends long ago.

Adam Ruins Everything	Weight Woe	The episode, "Adam Ruins Weight Loss" revolves around a guy named Sam who's trying to lose weight for his high school reunion, which for some reason, is going to be a pool party, in an attempt to impress his old high school crush. Adam spends the whole episode explaining why his dieting choices won't work, at least not in the long run. When they get to the reunion, it turns out his crush had put on some weight since high school as well. Adam himself even admits that he's not in great shape either, but instead of obsessing over it, he just tries to eat better and try to get some exercise in, resulting in a gradual, but healthy, change.

Actress	The Stinger	Several episodes feature a flashback scene of a younger Kanna (i.e., Kazumi Kato) talking with someone on a countryside field. She's talking to her sister and future manager, Rie, as they decide to move to Tokyo together to bring "Kanna Mase" into reality.

Adam Ruins Everything	Yet Another Christmas Carol	"Adam Ruins... Doing Good" takes this format. He shows an ailing, elderly Mr. Hulko, owner of the billion-dollar Hulko Corporation, that his stint in Teach for america in his twenties did more harm than good, by not properly teaching his students, and people only join the program to pad their resumes; the recycling program his company started in his thirties severely damaged the environment since one time use recyclables often end up in the trash, and countries like China will no longer accept trash from other countries to sort and recycle, since they need to sort and recycle their own trash; and his company's charity organization is just a scam, since billionaires will stock up money for a good cause, but when they need some extra spending cash they will dip into the charity and use it for their own benefit, and the money billionaires lobby the government to let them keep by cutting the tax rate, could be used to fund the programs that their charities are supposed to help with.

Actress	Accidental Kidnapping	Kiri finds the Twitter account of Kanna Mase's stalker and manages to track down his home, where he panics and locks her up for a few days. She's treated relatively well and learns a lot about Kanna's past during her confinement from her kidnapper, and he's not the murderer and is also taking care of his ill mother, so she decides not to report him to the police after she's freed.
Actress	Alter-Ego Acting	Kanna Mase is the "ideal actress" persona created by sisters Kazumi and Rie Kato, to fulfill their shared dream of leaving their hometown for the entertainment world. Kazumi became the physical form of Kanna Mase, while Rie became her manager and maintains her online presence. Their relationship became strained after Kazumi (as Kanna) agreed to take credit for Kiri's novel, as Rie believes that "Kanna Mase" wouldn't do such a thing.
Actress	Broken Pedestal	Kiri's actresses used to admire Kanna Mase until she got them fired from a production for no good reason, three months before the main story.
Actress	Central Theme	Every family has its issues, but in the end everyone in it has to be able to rely on each other.

Actress	Corrupt Corporate Executive	Kanna Mase's producer Konosu bribed two members of Kiri's troupe to steal Kiri's money and put her in debt, so that she'd be forced to join his agency to earn money to pay it back. He then persuaded Kiri into handing over her novel manuscript, which he then published as Kanna's work.
Actress	Covers Always Lie	The series poster depicts all seven Sakamichi members equally to keep the fans happy, but Kanon and Miki appear significantly less in the story than the others, while Kanna mostly appears in flashbacks.
Actress	Demoted to Extra	Unlike in the previous series, Kanon doesn't appear much in this series and mostly babysits Kotone's daughter when she's away solving mysteries.
Actress	Dresses the Same	Three months before the story's main events, Kanna made the director of the drama she starred in fire Kiri's troupe as extras, simply because Kiri wore the same red color to the shooting.
Actress	Girly Bruiser	Nao might be small, but she's still a former police detective and can subdue men larger than her.
Actress	Intrepid Reporter	The tabloid reporter Inuma figures out that Kiri Katayama is the real writer of Escape Beyond and threatens to publish an article implicating her in Kanna Mase's murder. After the real culprit was found and Konosu fired, it's implied that she leaked the information she possesses, once again reigniting the public's interest in the novel.
Actress	Jack the Ripoff	The story opens with a series of cat killings, killed in the same manner as in the popular webnovel and television drama Escape Beyond, written by and starring Kanna Mase. The culprit is her Otaku fan and former classmate who intended to help create buzz for her drama. He didn't kill Kanna and only mutilated cat corpses instead of slaughtering live ones. Subverted in the end, as it's revealed that Kanna's death was a crime of passion not inspired by the novel's plot in any way.
Actress	Parents as People	Kiri's parents disowned her as they disapproved of her theater career. Kotone has a discussion on parenting with her father, and also criticizes Kiri's mother for what she did. In the end, Kiri reunites with her mother, who has come to accept her life choice thanks to Kotone's urging.
Actress	Plot-Triggering Death	The first episode ends with Kanna being murdered in a manner similar to the case in her novel, Escape Beyond.
Actress	Poor Communication Kills	Kanna Mase, real name Kazumi Kato, was stressed out by the pressures of showbiz and treated her older sister and manager Rie poorly because of it. This, in addition to the stress of her own tumor diagnosis and the following hysterectomy, made Rie wrongly accuse Kazumi of sleeping with Rie's boyfriend, Oki, when Kazumi told her that she's pregnant, and she killed Kazumi in a fit of rage. She laments when she's apprehended that it wouldn't have come to that had they properly communicated their concerns as sisters.
Actress	The Prima Donna	Rising talent Kanna Mase is a haughty young woman and had extras in her drama fired just because their manager wore the same colored clothes with her.
Actress	Private Detective	Nao quit the police force to take care of her ill mother, and now works for the same detective agency as Tomomi, who was introduced to her by Kotone.
Actress	Punny Name	Mari Mizuta hates her name, since in Japanese order it's a homophone for "water puddle" (mizu tamari), so she goes by Miki Amano.
Actress	Stalker with a Crush	Kanna Mase's stalker has actually been in love with her (as Kazumi Kato) since they went to the same school. His feelings don't change even though she doesn't remember him at all, and he's heartbroken upon learning that she's been murdered.
Actress	Stealing the Credit	Escape Beyond was actually written by Kiri Katayama back in high school, but her agency credited it to their more famous talent (who wasn't even an author), Kanna Mase, despite Kiri's protests. When Kanna is murdered in a way similar to the novel, naturally Kiri becomes a suspect.
Adolescence	One-Steve Limit	Surprisingly broken for a four-episode series with relatively few characters, with two Pauls: one in the first episode and one in the last.
Affair	All Love Is Unrequited	Earth has one-sided feelings for Pleng. Frank has one-sided feelings for Wan. Ek has feelings for Wan, but while he does get to marry her, she never develops feelings for him and eventually leaves him.

Affair	Ambiguously Bi	Pleng and Ek.
Affair	Bathtub Bonding	A few times, the first back when they're 17.

Affair	The Cameo	As Lady Nueng appears in the final episode and the events of this show take place after the events of Blank, Anueng also makes an appearance, albeit by having her silhouette pass in front of the camera. This really only exists to remind the audience that Nueng and Anueng are still together.
Affair	Cosmic Motifs	Wan and Pleng's relationship is blatantly associated with the Gemini constellation.
Affair	Darker and Edgier	This show is even more dismal than its predecessors, featuring domestic abuse, gun violence, and multiple people resorting to suicide.
Affair	Driven to Suicide	Wut shoots himself in the head and dies. Ek shoots himself in the head and barely survives. Wan tries to drown herself in the ocean before being pulled back by Pleng. Pleng states she would've drowned herself just to be with her. And it's also heavily implied that Pleng tried to drown herself in her bathtub in episode 2. This makes a worrying total of 5 instances of a character either resorting to or considering suicide throughout this 8-episode run!
Affair	Foreshadowing	In episode 2, Khwan mentions that before the girls were born, she was admitted to the hospital for a while, prompting Wi to take care of her husband, Wut, in her stead. Over the episodes that follow, we catch glimpses of Wi still mourning Wut specifically. In episode 7, she reveals to the girls that she slept with Wut during that time. This thusly leads her to the conclusion that Pleng and Wan are half-siblings.
Affair	Good Adultery, Bad Adultery	Ek's is portrayed as wrong because he cheats on Wan, whom he actually loves but is constantly neglecting him. Wan's, on the other hand, is portrayed as justifiable because she's been trying to divorce him for some time and she was always in love with Pleng. The morality of Wut cheating with Wi is never brought up, though.
Affair	Heel–Face Turn	After Wan visits him in the hospital and hopes that he recovers from the heartbreak and goes on to find a woman who does actually love him, he decides to stop hounding her and sign the divorce papers. This allows him to move on from her as her friend and even find connection with another doctor.
Affair	In Medias Res	The first episode starts with a moment of passion between Dr. Wan and Pleng before transitioning back to their teen years. We return to this scene in episode 6 with the full context of how we got here.
Affair	Interclass Friendship	In their childhood, Pleng was rich and Wan was poor.
Affair	Maybe Ever After	Ek with the male doctor who tends to him in the finale.
Affair	Mood Whiplash	All it takes is the sound of a gun, and episode 2 goes from Pleng and Wan about to have their first kiss to Pleng losing both of her parents on the same night.
Affair	Love-Obstructing Parents	Wi becomes this when she learns Pleng and Wan are dating, telling them that they can't be together because they're sisters.
Affair	Queer Romance	Another one for the Girls' Love category, as the story deals with the relationship between Wan and Pleng, who are both women.
Affair	Sex at Work	Pleng almost bangs Wan in the doctor's lounge at the hospital before Dr. Guy comes in.
Affair	Surprise Incest	When Wi learns that Pleng and Wan are in love, she reveals to them that they're actually half-siblings. Pleng is shaken by this and Wan dismisses the notion vehemently. A DNA test is done and it reveals that they are, in fact, not related in the slightest. In Wi's defense, though, she was thoroughly convinced that they were sistersnote She had slept with Pleng's father while her mother was in the hospital. and thus shocked to see the results for herself.
A Cruel Love	Adaptation Name Change	Andy, Ruth's son, has his name changed to Andre in the TV series.
A Cruel Love	As the Good Book Says...	Humphreys: Do you know much about Buddhism, Mr. Bickford? I've practised it for 30 years. And one of its teachings is that we are all responsible for our own liberation. No—one else, no judge or jury, no friend, has put her in her present position. It is her own actions that have done so. That is karma.
A Cruel Love	Band of Brothers	Invoked by Stevenson, when he justifies why he didn't cross-examine Ruth. Bickford: This whole process has been a disgrace, a sham. I'm going to fight for her to be reprieved. Do things differently, as they should have been done. Desmond's cousin is in the same chambers as Christmas Humphreys. Stevenson: ... About Desmond... (Beat) Edward Cussen and I worked together during the War. Bickford: Jesus Christ! You were all in it together! Of course that's why you didn't cross-examine. They asked you to protect him! Stevenson: (smiles) No. They didn't.
A Cruel Love	Bitch in Sheep's Clothing	Richard Desmond appears to want to rescue Ruth from David, give her some stability and to help Andre grow up. He's taking advantage of her, and doesn't care for Andre once Ruth is gone.
A Cruel Love	Bookcase Passage	Only a shelf separates Ruth from the gallows while she awaits her fate.
A Cruel Love	Casting Gag	Nigel Havers plays his grandfather, Sir Cecil Havers, as the trial judge.
A Cruel Love	Caught on Tape	Averted. In real life, Ruth caught much of what David did to her on her tape recorder, but the evidence is never brought up in defence.
A Cruel Love	Crusading Lawyer	Reconstructed with John Bickford, Ruth's solicitor. He is shown to be out of his depth when he takes on the case of someone who openly admits to having committed the crime, but comes to Ruth's aid once the barrister fails to adequately cross-examine her. Thus he is a lawyer that you want to have, as the trope goes, but due to him withholding crucial information that could have helped Ruth's case, at her request, this series plays it in a slightly different way.
A Cruel Love	Den of Iniquity	Ruth's nightclub is frequented by the 1950s elite, and it's their way of letting their hair down and escaping the ultra-perfect lifestyles they're supposed to lead.
A Cruel Love	Department of Redundancy Department	Justified, as these were Ruth's first words after her arrest, and the series shows how unready she was. Ruth: I am guilty. I am rather confused.
A Cruel Love	Femme Fatale	Invoked. The defence successfuly portrays Ruth as one of these - a dangerous woman who would turn on men after getting into a relationship with them. Although there is more to the case, the jury take only 20 minutes to deliver a sentence of death.
Agent X	Freeze-Frame Bonus	Some tidbits of info regarding the characters can only be found by looking at screencaps very closely.
A Cruel Love	"Friends" Rent Control	Played straight and later subverted. Ruth gets a flat above the nightclub and originally the nightclub boss Morris Conley lets her have it for free, but once she brings David in he starts to charge her for it.
A Cruel Love	If It Bleeds, It Leads	An understated positive use of this trope. The front pages of the Daily Mirror publicise Ruth's case throughout, and question the necessity of the death penalty once Ruth's sentence is executed.
A Cruel Love	Imperiled in Pregnancy	Ruth has a miscarriage from David's abuse.
A Cruel Love	Intrepid Reporter	A subplot centres on journalist Jayveer Sethia, who is contacted by Joy Okoronote A member of the public present at the trial, who disagreed with the jury as she has information which could help her case. Unfortunately, without hard evidence that Cussen taught Ellis how to use a gun, he cannot get Joy's story published.
A Cruel Love	Kangaroo Court	Largely invoked. The court isn't directly biased against Ruth, but the fact that her barrister fails to cross-examine Desmond means that they are only given one side of the story.
A Cruel Love	Professional Voice Dissonance	Lampshaded about Ruth by David. She speaks with a much smoother and sexier voice on the telephone and when talking to men in her nightclub.
A Cruel Love	Slobs Versus Snobs	Deconstructed, and lampshaded throughout.
A Cruel Love	Smoking Hot Sex	After Desmond Cussen and Ruth have a good time, they're shown lighting up.
A Cruel Love	Sympathetic Murderer	Ruth Ellis is a nightclub hostessnote an euphemism for 'prostitute' who doesn't look after her children well and mixes with the wrong crowd, and is put to death for murder. However, she is continually abused and taken advantage of by the men with whom she associates, with one even causing her miscarriage. In-universe, a crowd of hundreds protesting her death gathers outside the prison, to support her when a reprieve seemed possible.
A Cruel Love	Unwanted Assistance	Ruth believes in the punishment and agrees with the sentence, and takes no part in her relatives' campaigns for clemency.
A Cruel Love	Wham Line	One line undermined Ruth's whole defence, and she ignored Bickford's instructions to say she did not intend to kill Blakely. Humphreys: When you fired the revolver at close range into the body of David Blakely, what did you intend to do? Ellis: It's obvious when I shot him I intended to kill him.

A Fist Within Four Walls	Signature Move	The "Fierce Tiger Climbing Mountain" technique of Au-Kuen's father. It's a plot point in that it was believed to be the technique that killed Duen Tung-tin, which Au-Kuen initially refused to relearn, but which ends up being the strike to eliminate the Big Bad.

A Discovery Of Witches	The Magic Goes Away	Magic is fading from the world, with witches' spells no longer nearly as powerful, daemons going mad increasingly and vampires unable to create more of their kind. Matthew states that if this happens, the humans will eventually notice it and find the world entirely dull.
A Discovery Of Witches	The Magic Comes Back	Or, that's the plan anyway. With The Book in the right (or wrong) hands the magic that's all but vanished could be brought back.

A Discovery Of Witches	Pining After Protagonist's Parent	Peter Knox carried a torch for Diana's late mother Rebecca, later confirming he was in love with her when Satu asks. He's initially warm towards Diana due to her reminding him of Rebecca, but he quickly becomes antagonistic due to being fixated on gaining access to her powers which was also how things ended with Rebecca. As Satu states, Knox may have loved Rebecca but he loved her power more and he was the one who killed her and her husband for defying him.

A Discovery Of Witches	Vampire Bites Suck	There is nothing romantic about being bitten by a vampire here. It's shown as causing realistic pain, and leaves a victim greatly weakened assuming they survive at all.
A Discovery Of Witches	Vampire Procreation Limit	Vampires can turn dying humans into vampires via a blood exchange; however, it doesn't work on humans that are already dead and they also have do transformations in a way that doesn't threaten The Masquerade (Marcus gets chastised for trying to turn his surgeon friend after he's fatally struck by a car in broad daylight, even though Marcus argued there was no one about and he couldn't just let him die). Another huge complication is that in the past fifty or so years, most vampires' attempt to make more of their kind has failed, with the humans just dying instead even if the exchange is completed in time; this is linked with the decline of magic in the world. Matthew de Clermont and his 'siblings' have been researching a way to resolve this problem.

Afterlife 2005	Artistic License – Medicine	There's an In-Universe example in an excerpt from a hack medical romance novel in which the doctor injects an unspecified medicine into the patient's "main artery". Besides the obvious issue here, medicine is injected into veins, not arteries. Injection into an artery could work, but it carries risks that using a vein doesn't, and is usually only done accidentally by drug addicts.
Afterlife 2005	Bath Suicide	One character slits her wrists in the bath after Allison claims to see her dead mother behind her.
Afterlife 2005	Bittersweet Ending	In the series finale, Robert dies of cancer, but Alison is finally able to reconcile with her father.
Afterlife 2005	British Brevity	Lasted 14 episodes over the course of two seasons.
Afterlife 2005	Cold Opening	One episode featured a variation where the perpetrator was a skeptic demonstrating how cold reading works. He is, of course, correct - except that he's now got an actual psychic in his circle.
Afterlife 2005	Fan Disservice	The sex scene in "Mirrorball". Natalia Tena is a very attractive woman with a fine figure, and the scene is a nice, erotic moment out of context. Not so much in context.
After MASH	The Alcoholic	Father Mulcahy became one of these after returning home, which is why he moves to Missouri to make a fresh start with his old pals from Korea.
After MASH	Christmas Episode	"All About Christmas Eve"
After MASH	Cliffhanger	The first season ended with Klinger put in jail just as his wife, Soon-Lee, is going into labor.
After MASH	Courtroom Episode	Season 2's "Trials", which sees Klinger defending himself on assault charges (and old "friend" Col. Flagg brought in as a witness for the prosecution).
After MASH	Disguised in Drag	Klinger dons a nurse's uniform to elude the cops in one episode.
After MASH	Dr. Jerk	Subverted with Boyer, who's initially rather caustic to staff and patients alike but soon softens considerably.
After MASH	Expy	Several of the supporting characters were these for former M*A*S*H regulars.
After MASH	Fish out of Water	Soon-Lee, who has a lot of cultural adjustment to get through as an immigrant in middle-class middle-America. (Example: Invited over to the Potters for dinner, Soon-Lee offers to wash the dishes after. When Mildred says there's no need as they have a dishwasher, she responds, "Oh, I would like to meet her!")
After MASH	From the Ashes	Despite the incredible resolution of the final episode of M*A*S*H, it still managed to spawn a follow-up the very next season, starring Colonel Potter, Klinger, and Father Mulcahy. This happened after a vote from the main cast of the former show voted not to continue for another season - these three actors voted in the minority to continue on. The new show took place in a veteran's hospital and attempted to mimic the dramatic turns of the later seasons of M*A*S*H while also bringing back some of the lighter comedy of the early seasons. It lasted for two seasons, never getting high ratings in its first season and being pitted against the intensely popular The A-Team in its second, which effectively slaughtered it.
After MASH	Local Hangout	A bar is conveniently across the street from the hospital.
After MASH	Obstructive Bureaucrat	A pair of these are the main source of conflict now that the war's over.
After MASH	Photo Montage	Used for the opening credits in season 1.
After MASH	Pointy-Haired Boss	Mike D'Angelo, the hospital administrator in season 1.
After MASH	Pun-Based Title	AfterMASH! It sounds like "aftermath"!
After MASH	Put on a Bus	Neither Pfeiffer nor D'Angelo made it past the first season. The former actually disappears without explanation, though he was as good as fired in his last appearance, while the latter is transferred to a different hospital in Montana.
After MASH	Repetitive Name	Potter works at Gen. Pershing Veterans Hospital, familiarly known as "General General".
After MASH	Retool	The second season. Season one went quite well. The show recognized its limits, and ended up placing 15th — great for a brand-new show — unless you happen to be CBS, which wanted the numbers its predecessor always pulled (in later seasons — early on, it too took a while). So Klinger went back into drag, Soon-Lee became a caricature, and Barbara Townsend's sturdy competent Mildred Potter was replaced by Anne Pitoniak's shrewish airhead, meant to make her "more like Gracie Allen". S1 had 22 eps and placed 15th; S2 had 8-10 eps and placed 90th.
After MASH	Running Gag	The hospital sits beside a railroad, so trains are frequently heard rumbling past.
After MASH	Sequel Series	Heavily promoted as a continuation of M*A*S*H as that show was ending. CBS' expectation that it would be the ratings equivalent of the 12th and subsequent seasons of M*A*S*H did it no favors, as shown in Retool above.TV Announcer: Coming soon to Monday nights, where it belongs...
After MASH	Shoot the Television	On the episode "All About Christmas Eve", Father Mulcahy gets a TV so that the long-term patients at the Missouri Veteran's Hospital can have it for Christmas and beyond. However, the airing of a soap opera with a story about a cheating wife infuriates a vet who fears that his wife is running around on him, and he summarily shoots the TV. Some vets are still staring through the hole in the set when all is done.
After MASH	Sugar-and-Ice Personality	Alma Cox, although the "sugar" side is mainly reserved for her unrequited crush D'Angelo.
After MASH	Thanksgiving Episode	"Thanksgiving of '53"
After MASH	Wrap It Up	The three main characters seen from the parent show come back and get resolution for their greatest troubles:
After MASH	You Can't Go Home Again	Klinger finally returns to Toledo, but his family and friends reject him for marrying a Korean.

Anton is the only one who realizes he is the stabber, but can't bring himself to decline an invitation to socialize and attempts to run him over instead. Fortunately the police arrive shortly.
Adults	Bait-and-Switch	The title, description, and opening scene of episode 8 all make it seem like the episode will be focused on the characters dealing with the mail they've been ignoring for months. However, once they find the letter about Paul Baker's visa expiring, the episode becomes entirely about securing him a Citizenship Marriage, and the mail never comes up again until the Brick Joke in the final seconds of the episode.
Adults	Bait-and-Switch Comment	At the dinner party, Billie's teacher boyfriend informs Samir that he's on a "pony dose" of ketaminenote a horse tranquilizer also used as a party drug, so named because if you gave it to a pony, it would also be high on ketamine.
Adults	Big Applesauce	Played with, the characters live in New York City but can't afford to live the glamor NYC exudes in media. In fact, they are mostly bumming in a house in the "shit-taint of Queens"note a borough still predominantly working-class. In episode 7 Annabelle, a teenage girl visiting from out of state, wants to see Wicked and go celebrity house-spotting, but Anton and Paul Baker note they can't afford that.
Adults	Brick Joke	In the opening scene of episode 8 Samir flips through a bunch of envelopes from ConEdison. He apparently does not realize it's the electricity company and the episode ends on the power going out.
Adults	Cast Full of Gay	While Anton and Paul Baker are the only ones who explicitly label themselves, all of the main characters seem to be somewhat sexually fluid:
Adults	The Charmer	Deconstructed. Anton is charming, extroverted, and gets along with just about anyone he meets, but it's always surface-level. He's bound to forget about any acquaintance he makes shortly after meeting them even though he makes them feel special, and ultimately cannot identify the Bayside Stabber in a police lineup after claiming to have felt a deep connection with him.
Adults	Childhood Friends	Samir and Billie went to high school together.
Adults	Citizenship Marriage	In episode 8 Paul Baker gets a notice that his visa is expiring and he has to return to Canada. Issa volunteers to marry him, but she married an old classmate Zack-Carlos as a joke years ago and she, Samir and Anton have been lying to Paul about it the whole time. Samir and Anton finally get her 'husband' to sign the divorce papers, but she gets cold feet. Ultimately Anton marries Paul.
Adults	Cordon Bleugh Chef	Billie is trying to become a better chef, and makes a roast chicken that looks absolutely perfect. Unfortunately,  she forgot to thaw it out before putting it in the oven, so it's still raw on the inside.
Adults	Courteous Canadian	Paul Baker is Canadian and by far the most polite and sweet-natured of the group.
Adults	Evil Former Friend	Zack-Carlos isn't directly evil, but he feels he was abandoned by the others and is unwilling to do them favours.
Adults	Forgotten First Meeting	Because he befriends absolutely everyone he meets, Anton doesn't really remember who half the people in his phone are. This becomes important when  the Bayside Stabber turns up in his house claiming to be his best friend, and Anton has absolutely no memory of who he is.
Adults	The Friend Nobody Likes	Zack-Carlos, hence why everyone abandoned him.
Adults	Full-Name Basis	Paul Baker is almost always referred by his full name.
Adults	Funny Contact Name	Literally everyone in Anton's phone.
Adults	Given Name Reveal	Billie's much older boyfriend and former high school teacher is known amongst the group as "Mr. Teacher", since none of them bothered to learn his actual name (not even Samir, who went to the same high school). His first name is finally revealed as Andrew when his ex-wife is forced to pick him up during Billie's attempted dinner party.
Adults	History with Celebrity	Paul is friends with actress/model Julia Fox (appearing As Herself) and invites her to the dinner party in episode 6, incurring Issa's jealousy. He also mentions to Anton that he's gym buddies with an actress named Scarlett.
Adults	Imagine Spot	Samir tends to visualize his negative thoughts in the physical world such as seeing "are you an idiot" on his bank forms and "Don't Samir this" as a pattern on a pillow while on a romantic getaway.
Adults	It's All About Me	Issa has a tendency to attempt to make herself the center of any situation from Kyle's rally, being Billie's proxy or competing with Julia Fox to be the "star" of a dinner party.
Adults	Jerk with the Heart of a Jerk	Annabelle is a rude, entitled brat who Anton and Paul Baker spend a whole episode being nice to in hopes of getting her to "open up", when they finally have a true heart to heart with her she does open up about what's bothering her and then... tells Anton and Paul Baker she'd kill herself if she were anything like them.
Adults	Love Epiphany	Implied between  Paul Baker and Anton in the season finale. The others tell them they need to kiss to  make their Citizenship Marriage official, and when they do, it quickly becomes clear to everyone that it's more than just a Platonic Kiss.
Adults	Mood Whiplash	Episode 4 is very silly, but at the end, Anton goes off to meet his date, though immediately has second thoughts and it's clear he doesn't want to go through with it. He sneaks back into the house and lies to the others about his location.
Adults	Mooning	Samir does a virtual interview for a fintech company and they offer him the job on the spot. When they prod him into celebrating more he gets up, dances, and flashes his bare butt at the camera. They are disgusted and rescind the offer immediately.
Adults	Morality Pet	Paul Baker serves as this to the other four leads. Where Samir, Billie, Anton and especially Issa can all be immature, selfish and slightly amoral, Paul Baker is an All-Loving Hero who is instantly kind to anyone he meets and they all care about him deeply as best displayed in the season finale where they all, sincerely and eagerly, offer to marry him so he can stay in the country.
Adults	Magical Defibrillator	Invoked. While waiting for Billie's medical procedures to finish, Anton and Paul play-act a scene where Paul is unconscious and Anton uses a defibrillator on him while asking him to Please Wake Up. They later thank the nurse who let them touch the equipment.
Adults	Medium Awareness	Played With. Issa pawns off the teen girl she volunteered to temporarily house off on Paul Baker and Anton and when asked about it says it's a "Paul Baker and Anton plotline now".
After Life 2019	Mood Whiplash	Given the subject matter, and the fact that the series is a Black Comedy, this happens often. Indeed, it can happen not only during the same scene, but occasionally, within two sentences.
A History Of Scotland	What Could Have Been	Mary of Scotland was nearly nearly Mary of Scotland, England AND France.
Adults	Misery Poker	Parodied. Kyle gives a speech about how he was a victim of sexual assault. When Issa offers to galvanize the crowd, he says that she isn't qualified as she isn't a victim. She says that she's a woman with Immigrant Parents (Anton: "Your parents are from London!") and a sex worker (she has an OnlyFans account). This is more than enough oppression for Kyle and he lets her speak.
Adults	Mr. Exposition	
Adults	Nice Guy	In a show where the leads are all works in progress who are prone to selfish, not entirely ethical behavior, Paul Baker stands out as a truly kindhearted, sweet, and somewhat naive person who cares deeply about his friends and is nice to almost everyone he meets.
Adults	No Sense of Personal Space	The group's codependence is established in the second episode's Cold Open, when everyone drops into the house's only bathroom one-by-one despite Billie still using the toilet and casually talk amongst each other.
Adults	N-Word Privileges	In the third episode the group proposes that Issa stop saying the 'f-slur'. The LGBT Anton says that he grandfathered her in.
Adults	Office Sports	Anton and Paul induce wheelchair racing while Billie is hospitalized, which even the nurses and other patients get up to. In the same episode the two play "Gauze Ball" off screen.
Adults	Out-of-Context Eavesdropping	At the funeral of his and Issa's therapist George, Anton overhears a mourner tutting about how tragic it was for George's wife to "find him like that". Anton jumps to the conclusion that George committed suicide, and he and Issa spiral about it. They even consult a medium to hold a seance so they could speak to George. In the end it turns out George died in a bathroom accident.
Adults	Person as Verb	As he's stepping out of the house to take his girlfriend Carly upstate, Issa asks Samir not to "Samir it" (i.e. screw it up).
Adults	Potty Emergency	In the second episode, Anton is desperate to use the toilet, but Billie is already sitting on it. He asks her to open her legs so he can pee through them. Issa notes that he has a very good aim in this regard.
Adults	Questionable Consent	After a high school friend makes national news for being molested at work, Samir is astounded to learn that men don't realize they're crossing a line sexually half the time. He reaches out to his exes and is horrified to learn that he once slept with one while she was drunk.
Adults	Roommate Com	The show is about a group of friends who live together in a house and the shenanigans they get up to.
Adults	Running Gag	
Adults	Shockingly Expensive Bill	Billie is aghast to be charged $15000 for the endoscopy, vaginoscopy, and colonscopy Samir ordered while she was unconscious, because she's uninsured. Thankfully, she's eventually able to bring it down to $2200 and pay it off.
Adults	Sixth Ranger	
Adults	The Social Expert	Anton is very social. In the first episode he treats Kyle's fundraiser like a party; in the second episode he convinces the nurses to let them play with medical equipment. In episode 3, a man suspected of being a stabber turns out to have been a onetime encounter of his, and while showing the group the texts it turns out he has a host of random acquaintances. Overall, he's very charismatic, but also a people pleaser.
Adults	Somebody Doesn't Love Raymond	Anton, who takes pride in his extreme likability, is irritated when Annabelle acts rude and sassy towards him.
Adults	Surprisingly Realistic Outcome	In episode 7, Issa leads her ballet students in a protest against the school's administration when told to perform Swan Lake instead of their original work Popcorn Forest, locking herself in the classroom with them and chanting slogans. As soon as her class time is over, she stops the protest and sends the kids home because "what am I gonna do, keep them overnight?" and acquiesces to her bosses' demands. She also mentions later that she's been put on probation at her job as a result of the incident.
Adults	Visual Pun	In the first episode, Issa asks Kyle (a victim of workplace sexual assault) if she can speak at his rally. He shows her a card in a lanyard that says 'victim' and says she can't because she doesn't have one, i.e. he's literally playing the victim card. Issa counters by showing him other cards that say she's a female child of immigrants and a sex worker. He lets her speak.
Aftermath	After the End	Every episode leads to an apocalypse and either culminates in humanity's extinction or a post-apocalyptic future where humans have adapted to the hypothetical scenario.
Aftermath	The End of the World as We Know It	Every single episode has this happen. It's obviously the whole point of Population Zero, given that it deals with the aftermath of humanity's extinction, but even the scenarios that one would least expect to lead to an apocalypse do.
Aftermath	Next Sunday A.D.	When each scenario occurs.
Aftermath	Shown Their Work	In excruciating detail. The narrator explains exactly what the scenario changes, why it has changed, and what a particular changed thing's status quo depends on in our reality that has been removed with the scenario.
Aftermath	Speculative Documentary	The whole point of each episode.
Aftermath	Apocalypse How	Class 3. It's unknown why or how every human on Earth disappeared other than A Wizard Did It
Aftermath	Big Dam Plot	The Glen Canyon and Hoover Dams eventually collapse after 200 years, restoring the Colorado river's free access to the sea.
Aftermath	Going Critical	Because the presently active nuclear power plants across the globe are no longer being manned after humanity's disappearance, it's only a matter of time before they go into nuclear meltdown. Whole regions are turned into death zones for decades to come for any animals trying to survive.
Aftermath	Escaped Animal Rampage	All animals in zoos and safari parks have to escape their confines or starve, as humans are no longer there to feed them. This leads to such unusual sights as bush elephants migrating through suburbs while fending off packs of feral dogs, camels wandering through graveyards and lions desperately trying to catch monkeys and baboons hiding out in playgrounds.
Aftermath	Humanity's Wake	The whole point of this episode. Humans inexplicably vanish and the focal point is how the earth's ecology is impacted in different time periods after humanity's extinction as well as the eventual destruction of humanity's artifices, one by one.
Aftermath	Humans Are the Real Monsters	As the narration points out, there are multiple ways in which the lives of multiple species are improved in the long run once humans are removed from the equation.
After Life 2019	Morality Pet	Anne, the widow that Tony befriends, often acts as this, helping Tony to curb his worst impulses, and teaching him to understand that helping others lead a good life can be just as rewarding as leading one yourself.
After Life 2019	Pet the Dog	
After Life 2019	Posthumous Character	Lisa, who we only see via old videos that Tony watches on his laptop.
Aftermath	Monumental Damage	Famous monuments such as the Eiffel Tower and the Statue of Liberty begin to degrade from unaddressed rust decay and erosion after about a century. The Eiffel Tower eventually disappears in a new swamp that appears in the Paris metropolitan area, the Statue of Liberty falls apart and its pedestal is ground down by the expanding Ice Age glacier in North America and even the pyramids of Egypt that had stood strong for thousands of years eventually end up buried underneath the desert sand.
Aftermath	Post-Apocalyptic Dog	Once their masters vanish, the dogs who were left behind are forced to escape from their homes or die, and only the strongest dogs are able to survive for long - toy dogs (due to their small size and dependence on human care) die off within weeks. Feral dogs start forming packs and hunting other animals, including escaped zoo animals.
Aftermath	Reclaimed by Nature	The pilot episode theorizes what would happen after humanity suddenly vanishes. Most human structures take only a century or two to decay. The only thing indicated to last many millions of years is the moon lander left behind on the airless rock.
Aftermath	Ruins of the Modern Age	The ruined remains of the modern cities are shown succumbing to nature's relentless advances, alongside several ancient ruins surviving for much longer.
Aftermath	Time Abyss	After humanity vanishes, most signs of its civilization disappear within a few centuries time, the remainder after the next ice age. Other lifeforms move on and adapt. Planet Earth is 4.5 billion years old, the universe three times that; humanity's whole existence was just the blink of an eye.
Aftermath	Apocalyptic Underground Refuge	The humans are eventually driven to live underground due to the levels of radiation and heat. Most of them die out when Earth's surface temperature reaches 371 °C, as the internal heat from Earth's mantle prevents them from going low enough to escape the heat from the surface. As such, they escape into space.
Aftermath	Earth-Shattering Kaboom	The Sun slows down the Earth's orbit before the planet disintegrates and is subsequently consumed by the dying star.
Aftermath	Heat Wave	As the Sun rapidly ages, the Earth's temperature also rises.
Aftermath	Homeworld Evacuation	When temperatures on Earth reach the point that not even the underground is safe to live in, the last remaining humans escape the planet on starships and settle on the moons of the outer Solar System.
Aftermath	Irony	When the temperature reaches 149 °C, it gets too hot for humans to walk on the surface of the earth without a spacesuit. At that very same point, there is not enough oxygen for fire to be possible.
Aftermath	Kill It with Fire	Due to the aforementioned temperature spike, oxygen levels fall to less than 10%, making it impossible for things to truly burn. Objects that can melt or evaporate are still destroyed, but fire can't burn until it gets so hot that water vapor escaping into space is split via hydrolysis, allowing oxygen to return. Anything that survives is consumed in mass firestorm.
Aftermath	Misplaced Vegetation	Early on, the higher temperatures and lower levels of carbon dioxide cause maples, oaks and evergreens to experience a mass die-off. This allows plants like bamboo and long grasses to move northward, resulting in Chicago and Toronto having foliage like that of Southeast Asia.
Aftermath	Post-Apocalyptic Gas Mask	The recurring astronaut.
Aftermath	Crapsack World	What we finally end up with when the world finally stops spinning entirely. Most of the world's population has died and what humans are left have been forced to retreat to isolated colonies with no hope of progressing beyond subsistence.
Aftermath	Depopulation Bomb	Given that Most of the world has been made unsafe to live in, in some cases by what constitute natural disasters, until the only habitable areas are by the coasts of the new mega-continent by the polar oceans, what else would you expect?
Aftermath	Earthquakes Cause Fissures	We don't see the full effect of this, but it's explained that one consequence of slowly slowing the Earth down would be extremely powerful earthquakes in places that had never seen earthquakes before; Earth's magnetic field relies on the fact that the layers of the Earth spin at their own speeds. Change that speed, and the change varies from layer to layer, resulting in ungodly amounts of friction coming into play, manifesting as gigantic quakes.
Aftermath	Everytown, America	AKA Flyover Country. Ironically enough, one of the safer places to be once the Earth has completely stopped is what's left of the American Midwest. It's just out of reach of the flooding and the worst of the solar radiation, though humans living there would only just be able to make by through subsistence, and face a perilous first few years there without desalination plants to extract water from the ocean.
Aftermath	Fire/Water Juxtaposition	Two of them. One is the difference between the poles and the equator as the earth slows. While the poles are flooded, the equator is not only dry, but also has a atmosphere too thin to sustain human life. The other is the "day/night" cycle left after as the Earth slows and eventually stops. The hot, scorching day, and the dark, freezing night.
Aftermath	Hope Spot	The survivors who head to the American Midwest manage to build subsistence farms and fish for their food, but face ever-decreasing rainfall as the Earth continues to slow. When it stops completely, there's no longer any Coriolis Effect. Without any wind to push storms at sea over land and not enough energy or resources to desalinate ocean water, it's going to seriously suck for them.
Aftermath	The Insomniac	The lengthening of days as the earth's spin slows to a stop messes up everyone's sleep cycle. Their ability to sleep is impaired during the times when practically speaking, it is daytime and yet time-wise, it is still night.
Aftermath	Regional Redecoration	As a consequence of the Earth's slowing spin, the planet's equatorial bulge begins to flatten out, causing the oceans to start flowing north and south. The result is two vast oceans covering the top and bottom thirds of the world, while a vast supercontinent joins the world's major landmasses. Miami is left hundreds of miles from the coast, while everything north of Kansas is underwater.
Aftermath	Robinsonade	The fate of the scientists who set sail for the equatorial supercontinent. They make it almost the entire way there, but a strong storm near the equator wrecks their ship on the shore of the new land. While they have enough supplies to last for a little while, the group faces an uncertain fate, given a combination of thin air and the unforgiving rays of the Sun.
Aftermath	Sleepyhead	The lengthening of the days, as well as making everyone in the world The Insomniac when the sun is out when it is usually nighttime, turns people into this when it is dark during the traditional daytime.
Aftermath	Stock Scream	The Howie Long Scream is used when a rock climber, due to a lack of oxygen at high altitudes once the Earth slows, falls to his death.
A French Village	Depraved Homosexual	Corrupt, highly antisemitic Louis turns out to be gay. Jérôme, his lover, shares his view.
Aftermath	Three Lines, Some Waiting	The story mainly follows three different groups: one heading for low-lying states like Kansas, one staying in Miami and one leaving San Francisco to colonize the new supercontinent. The first is ultimately doomed to starvation when the Coriolis Effect shuts down, the second abandons Miami once their resources run out and the latter-most manage to build a small colony. After a year, the Miami group manages to migrate westward and joins up with them.
Aftermath	The Apocalypse Brings Out the Best in People	Inverted with the United States closing its borders entirely because of the influx of refugees and migrants. Played straight, however, in that the various problems that result from the increased population result in scientists uniting to solve them and, most importantly, in ways that ensure the survival of as many people as possible.
Aftermath	Mega City	Most of the population of North America becomes concentrated around the Great Lakes after a drought-induced mass migration. A massive mega city surrounds the lakes.
Aftermath	Overpopulation Crisis	The episode explores exactly this, when the population of Earth spontaneously doubles overnight. At first humanity tries to cope by rationing resources and rapidly expanding construction, but eventually society breaks down, resulting in huge population movements and an eventual Depopulation Bomb that results in a still fairly large, but dramatically reduced human race.
Aftermath	The Plague	The first variant happens as a result of the increased population. The plumbing is strained from multiple people flushing the toilets, causing the waste water to taint the supply of drinking water, causing outbreaks of cholera.
Aftermath	Water Source Tampering	An unintentional variant. Desperate attempts to grow enough food to feed the increased population as well as strains on the plumbing result in much of the world's water being unsafe to drink, if one can even find or attain any of it.
Aftermath	Bittersweet Ending	Despite the chaos and trauma of the first few decades, gradually humanity is able to adapt to a post-oil world with renewable technologies, urban farming, and mass transit.
Aftermath	Cozy Catastrophe	Some countries manage to largely mitigate the issues with a world without oil by using ethanol-based biofuel, particularly in the case of Brazil, which already has a massive biofuel program that it uses to great effect, making it through the crisis in much better shape than a lot of other nations around the planet. Why more technologically advanced countries such as the United States don't start a crash biofuel project is left unanswered, especially since the US military had such a program in development for years at the time the show was aired precisely to address the Post-Peak Oil scenario.
Aftermath	Days of Future Past	Eventually, people start growing their own food and keeping livestock, in a similar manner to most people before the advent of mechanised farming. Later still, once lithium and biofuel technology becomes widespread, new towns are formed along railroad tracks, in much the same way settlements during the 19th century were founded in places like the American Midwest.
Aftermath	Here We Go Again!	In the last segment, 40 years after the oil disappeared, rechargeable electric batteries have become commonplace especially for vehicles. A news clip discusses the approach of 'peak lithium' in a few years when the world's lithium supplies are no longer commercially viable...meaning the scenario is likely to repeat itself. That being said, some nations opted to rely on Ethanol biofuel instead, growing plants to turn into alcohol; these nations are more likely to thrive when Lithium begins to run low, and will probably have quite a few things to teach the world when that day comes. Even before then, the world's coal reserves are stripped with frightening speed, as non-equatorial nations resort to it for winter heating and demand for fuel to run emergency vehicles makes extracting liquid fuel from processed coal a necessity.
Aftermath	Hidden Supplies	Deconstructed; people who have conserved or hoarded gasoline find out that it has a limited shelf life (a few months to a year). One family learns this the hard way when it tries to drive a sick child to the hospital.
Aftermath	Ludd Was Right	As social infrastructure collapses, it turns out that the old-fashioned way is the best way. Those who grow their own food and keep livestock, as well as doing other things that aren't mentioned the old-fashioned way, make it through the crisis. Even 40 years after the oil supplies ran out and humanity has adapted to this new fact of life, society is still agrarian, growing their food locally and growing only what they need.
Aftermath	Post-Peak Oil	The episode presents a rather extreme hypothetical by erasing all the oil supplies in the world at once, rather than having demand gradually outstrip supply like a regular Post-Peak Oil scenario. The world quickly descends into chaos while some countries manage to cope by switching to alternative energy sources. However, at the end a similar Post-Peak problem is foreshadowed with the mineral lithium.
After Life 2019	Actually Pretty Funny	Sandy often has this reaction to a lot of the (highly) inappropriate stuff that comes out of Tony's mouth.
After Life 2019	Adolf Hitlarious	One of the stories Tony and Lenny cover is a couple who claims that their newborn child looks like Hitler. It's just a regular baby that they've drawn a mustache on, and dressed in a uniform.
After Life 2019	Ambiguous Ending	The series final scene ends on this note as it shows Tony and Brandy walking away from the Tambury fair and it shows an image of Lisa walking with them, back when she was still alive before she disappears. The season then changes to Autumn and Brandy disappears, showing that she likely died of old age, leaving Tony alone before he too disappears on the same Autumn day. While the ending obviously indicates that Tony will eventually die, it's left ambiguous whether it will be because of natural causes or if Tony will kill himself now that he has lost the last thing he felt connected him to the world. Though Word of God confirms that Tony didn’t kill himself.
After Life 2019	The Alcoholic	Tony starts to become one as the series progresses. Interestingly, it doesn't seem to affect his ability to function at work. Nor, as it turns out in Season 3, his ability to beat Matt in various athletic activities, even drinking a pint of beer while playing squash.
After Life 2019	The Anti-Nihilist	Tony embraces nihilism and takes it as an excuse to hurt others and do whatever he likes because he's too suicidal to care. However, he learns the importance of community and helping each other after being called out for ignoring the pain of other people and for believing he's the only one suffering in the world.
After Life 2019	Author Avatar	In usual fashion, Gervais uses Tony as a mouthpiece for many of his more-famous opinions regarding God and religion, the afterlife, the supernatural, children, animals, fame...
A French Village	Released to Elsewhere	People are vague as to where Jews go in the end, openly admitting in many cases that they don't know. Only a few know (or accept) the truth.
A French Village	Reminiscing About Your Victims	
After Life 2019	Bittersweet Ending	The series ends on this note; Tony realises that he will never again be as happy as he was when Lisa was alive and, depending on how you read the final scene, may eventually kill himself after his beloved dog Brandy dies. However, Tony decides that he will spend what time he has left caring for others again, content in basking in the happiness he can spread for his friends, as shown by him happily looking on at all off his friends whose lives he improved as they enjoy themselves at the Tambury fair.
After Life 2019	Black Comedy	As if it weren't obvious due to being a series about grieving the death of a loved one created by Ricky Gervais. Suprisingly, though, very little humor is focused on the grieving process itself; much of the comedy comes from Tony's interactions with his colleagues and the townspeople of Tambury.
After Life 2019	Brutal Honesty	Tony's specialty. Tony: Here’s what’s what: humanity is a plague. We’re a disgusting, narcissistic, selfish parasite, and the world would be a better place without us. It should be everyone’s moral duty to kill themselves. I could do it now. Quite happily just go upstairs, jump off the roof, and make sure I landed on some cunt from accounts.
After Life 2019	Butt-Monkey	Lenny, the Gazette's photographer, often serves as this to Tony, who constantly mocks and belittles him during the series. Tony does eventually ease up on him, though.
After Life 2019	Character Catchphrase	"Fuck's sake!" for Tony.
After Life 2019	Character Development	Tony starts the series bitter, jaded, and suicidal having given up on life in general after the death of Lisa. He decides to take his anger out on everyone around him, calling it his "superpower" and is seen either trying to kill himself or put himself at life threatening risk as he no longer cares about his life. However, after hitting his low point at the end of series one  by knowingly giving Julian enough money to overdose on drugs and threating George's bully with a hammer Tony realises that not caring is actively putting others at risk and resolves to be a better person. He becomes less suicidal (though with occasional relapses) and strives to only use his superpower on arseholes who deserve it. By the end of the series Tony decides to care for people again having realised that being good to other people, instead of dismissive, that is the right superpower to strive for.
After Life 2019	Cloudcuckoolander	Many of the Tambury townspeople, especially the subjects that Tony and Lenny interview for the Gazette. Particular mention to the Psychiatrist, who seems less interested in providing actual therapy to his patients, and more in discussing sexual subjects and partying instead.
After Life 2019	Country Matters	
After Life 2019	Deadpan Snarker	It's a Ricky Gervais series. Written by Ricky Gervais. You do the math.
After Life 2019	Derailing Love Interests	This happens to Roxy and Pat in series 3 as, despite getting together with each other in the previous seasons, Pat becomes increasingly insecure about Roxy's job as a sex worker. After getting some ill advice from Roger, Pat gives Roxy an ultimatum, she can either be with him or stay a sex worker. She chooses her job and breaks up with Pat which leaves him open to getting together with Kath at the end of the series. This seems to have been done in part because Rosine Conaty didn't return for series 3.
After Life 2019	Driven to Suicide	Tony hit this point after Lisa's death, and would have succeeded if not for his dog. At the end of Season 2, he hits it again, and, again, manages to be saved at the last second.
After Life 2019	Extreme Doormat	Tony's boss and brother-in-law Matt is introduced with shades of this, with Tony even telling Matt that he will let him get away with doing and saying whatever he wants because of this. He does show more assertiveness as the series progresses, however, especially after Tony threatens one of his son's schoolmates with a hammer.
After Life 2019	Gonk	Lenny. In one episode, Tony tells him that he looks like Shrek.
After Life 2019	Happy Flashback	Used to devastating effect on the show, with Tony constantly watching videos of his and Lisa's life together.
After Life 2019	Hate Sink	The guy Kath goes on a date with in a Season 3 episode. He spends the entire date nitpicking at her for every little slight, openly mocks her for her beliefs, and needlessly insults the waiter, all while having a smug, self-centered air about him. It says a lot when Kath unabashedly calls him a cunt, even after vowing to never use the word in her life.
After Life 2019	Heroes Love Dogs	The fact that Tony has a dog that he showers with affection and never mistreats despite his emotional anguish is a key factor in making him a likeable and sympathetic character.
After Life 2019	Hooker with a Heart of Gold	Roxy/Daphne, a prostitute (sorry, "sex worker") that Tony ends up hiring to tidy up his house. She ends up becoming one of his closest friends during the course of the series.
After Life 2019	Hypocritical Humor	Tony constantly mocks Lenny about his weight, despite the fact that he himself isn't much lighter.
After Life 2019	Inexplicably Identical Individuals	David Earl's character, Brian, may or may not be Brian Gittens, an extremely-similar character he has portrayed in numerous other works, including the short Brian and Charles, the series 4Funnies, and Gervais' film Cemetary Junction. If so, this would make the character The Ageless, given that Cemetary Junction was set in the 70's.
After Life 2019	Insistent Terminology	Roxy is a sex worker, not a prostitute.
After Life 2019	Interrupted Suicide	Happens twice to Tony: the first time, Brandy the dog interrupts him in the bathtub, and the second time, Emma arrives at the doorstep.
After Life 2019	It's All About Me	Much of Tony's initial attitude very much smacks of this. His decision to be as unpleasant and honest as possible is largely built around trying to distract himself from his grief. His Character Development over the course of the series is about him recognizing that he isn't the only one dealing with pain, and the better response is to try and live for others instead.
After Life 2019	I Want My Beloved to Be Happy	The point of the video messages that Lisa leaves Tony, exhorting him to move on with his life, and learn to be happy without her. She even encourages him to find someone else after she's gone.
After Life 2019	Jerk with a Heart of Gold	Tony himself; he's blunt, rude, abrasive and dismissive of others' feelings, yet deep down, he's fundamentally a good guy with a caring heart, who eventually recognizes that he's simply lashing out due to his grief, and takes it upon himself as the series progresses to try and be better to those around him.
After Life 2019	The Lost Lenore	Lisa for Tony. His love for her was so deep and encompassing that her loss profoundly affects him in ways that resonate for months afterwards. It's also the reason why he finds himself unable to commit to a new relationship with Emma, despite her clear and obvious interest in him. Tony: I'd rather be nowhere with her, than somewhere without her.
After Life 2019	Replacement Goldfish	Deconstructed with Tony's relationship with Emma the nurse who looks after Tony's dad. Despite a rocky start the two hit it off and become friends, with Tony mentioning that seeing her improves his day. However, Tony is still in love with Lisa and can only give Emma vague assurances that one day he may be able to move their relationship to the next phase without feeling like he's cheating on his wife. While Emma agrees to those terms its clear in series three that both her and Tony are just trying to replicate moments he had with Lisa, meaning their relationship is stuck in limbo and isn't healthy for either of them. Eventually, after Emma meets an old flame of hers, Tony tells her she should peruse him having realised that he is keeping her trapped in a relationship he knows won't progress any further.
After Life 2019	Sir Swears-a-Lot	Tony seems to find it difficult to go longer than a minute without swearing, even when talking to his interview subjects.
After Life 2019	Skewed Priorities	When Matt learns that Tony threatened a 10-year-old child he finally blows up at him and threatens to cut off all contact with George. While his anger with Tony is understandable he also never acknowledges Tony telling him that the child in question was bullying George and we never see Matt follow up on this information.
After Life 2019	Suicide by Pills	In the season 2 finale, Tony decides to try and commit suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills after his father dies. It's only the timely arrival of Emma at his doorstep that stops him.
After Life 2019	Suspiciously Similar Substitute	In series 3 Coleen, a minor character from the previous series, becomes the newest intern of the Tambury Gazette with Matt even noting that she is taking over Sandy's old job (who has disappeared from the show between seasons).
After Life 2019	Unwitting Instigator of Doom	
After Life 2019	Video Will	Lisa, recognizing how hard it will be for Tony to look after himself without her, leaves a series of video messages for him designed to inspire him to keep on living. Tragically, at the end of Season 2, it almost has the opposite effect.
After Life 2019	What Happened to the Mouse?	Despite being major characters in the first two series Sandy and Daphne disappear with only offhanded mentions in series three, that seems to indicate that Sandy has moved on to another job and Daphne being too busy at work to visit Tony anymore.
After Life 2019	What the Hell, Hero?	Matt gives one to Tony after discovering that Tony threatened his son George's bully, a 10-year-old child, with a hammer. Although Tony tries to downplay it, it proves to be Matt's last straw, and he threatens to cut all contact between Tony and George entirely.
After School 1992	Fate Drives Us Together	The shared issue of having to live each others lives brings the two closer together, and they are destined to continue together once the problem is solved.
After School 1992	"Freaky Friday" Flip	Azusa and Kouhei switch bodies.
After School 1992	Gender Bender	Azusa (female) and Kouhei (male) switch bodies.
After School 1992	Opposites Attract	Azusa and Kouhei couldn't be more polar opposite.
A French Village	Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder	Hubert, a French POW, came home and found that his wife had born a son with another man. For the boy's sake, he'd claimed him, but Hubert clearly resents her for this.
A French Village	Abusive Parents	As a result of her paranoia after World War II, Hortense starts to believe that Tequiero (her adopted son) has been trying to kill her, and thus locks him in a closet to protect herself.
A French Village	Affably Evil	Müller is usually quite polite and friendly, even very charming. His feelings for Hortense also seem genuine. Even so, he's a ruthless torturer and organized mass murders of Jews in the Soviet Union without qualms.
A French Village	Age-Gap Romance	Daniel has relationships with two women significantly younger than him. Hortense isn't quite as much (her actress is twenty years younger than Daniel's). Sarah definitely was though (a nearly thirty year age gap between the actors).
A French Village	All Germans Are Nazis	Averted. In fact, the Communists initially go out of their way to distinguish Nazis from ordinary, working class German soldiers whom they insist must not be lumped together. Even when the Communists begin resistance, they insist upon targeting only officers because of this view, and one shouts out "Long live the German Communist Party!" when he's shot, acknowledging this symbolically. Most German characters don't express Nazi views, even Müller, who's in the SD (the SS's intelligence service) so presumably a Nazi. Even their antisemitic operations are also engaged in by French people.
A French Village	All Girls Want Bad Boys	Hortense finds Müller quite attractive and has an intermittent relationship with him. She even explains his appeal as being how cold and selfish he is. Even the fact he tortured Hortense at one point to coerce her husband into giving up information or related how he oversaw mass murders in the Soviet Union doesn't change her view, which pushes this to its greatest extreme.
A French Village	Anachronic Order	Used heavily in the last season. The plot threads of that season—trials of the collaborators, a labor dispute at the mill, Hortense getting committed to an asylum—are intercut in every episode with flash-forward scenes decades into the future, as late as the early 21st century, showing what happened to the various characters after the war.
A French Village	Anyone Can Die	Several major characters are killed by the end of the series, along with numerous minor ones.
A French Village	Appeal to Force	A lot of times German officials simply ignore French objections when they break the Armistice's terms, since there's nothing that can be done to stop it as the Germans have the power.
A French Village	Argentina Is Nazi-Land	By the 60s, former SS officer Müller is living in Paraguay, working as a trainer of torturers with the Schneider dictatorship.
A French Village	Armored Closet Gay	Lucienne, after acting quite homophobic toward Marguerite, kisses and even has sex with her (though after she apologizes). In her case she's probably bisexual, since her previous relationships were with men and there's no sign she didn't like them.
A French Village	Artistic License – Military	In the series' first season, the commanding officer of Villeneuve's German garrison is addressed as "Mein Kommandant", a literal (and incorrect) German translation of the French way of addressing to an officer having the rank of major (German officers aren't addressed this way, not to mention "Kommandant" isn't even a real German word). The correct phrase would be "Herr Major".
A French Village	Asshole Victim	Louis, an openly antisemitic Vichy official who tries to blackmail Raymond into getting part of a Jewish-owned company when it's "Aryanized" (i.e. transferred into gentile hands) is shot by him instead.
A French Village	Auto Erotica	Raymond and Marie, after breaking off their affair, later have another tryst in his car.
A French Village	Awful Truth	Max, a French Communist liberated from a concentration camp by the Red Army, spent time in the Soviet Union before being sent home. All his comrades are eager to hear about what they believe is a worker's paradise, but he pleads weariness and declines. Later he confesses to Edmond what it's really like-constantly being watched by the secret police, and thousands having been shot in the purges under Stalin. It's clear that he's shaken to the core, given that Western Communists had lionized the Soviet Union and denied such atrocities earlier.
A French Village	Bedlam House	Hortense, after developing a paranoid disorder, is sent to a psychiatric hospital where she's "treated" with hot baths, electroconvulsive therapy, drugs and restraints that do nothing except exacerbate her condition (as now she's sensibly afraid of what the staff will do). This is very realistic, unfortunately, for the 1940s. Even worse, many patients are being left to die in a building they call "Purgatory" because with food shortages they can't all be fed.
A French Village	Better to Die than Be Killed	Marchetti is sentenced to death for murder, and has Rita smuggle in poison because he wants it on his terms. He takes it and dies with her beside him.
A French Village	Bigot with a Crush	Jean Marchetti is a French policeman who helped round up Jews and holds antisemitic views. He falls in love though with a Jewish woman named Rita, getting into a relationship and saving her from deportation to the East. They conceive a child and discuss marrying. After this, he grows more sympathetic to Jews, helping a Jewish family to escape. This doesn't mean he entirely becomes a better person though. Rita leaves him in anger when she learns he let her mother be shipped away to Poland, and when she's back from Switzerland (where Jean sent them for safety) doesn't want him to have any part of their son's life. However, he still saves them from being sent to a death camp, this time even shooting a German officer in doing so.
A French Village	Blackmail	Jules gets Lucienne to do what he says at one point by threatening that he'll reveal she'd been in a relationship with a German soldier (who fathered her daughter), which would end her career and lose her custody.
A French Village	Blackshirt	A fair number of French people willing serve the Vichy regime and German occupiers, not just in the more innocuous ways, but eagerly aiding antisemitic persecution. Many express their pleasure that they can now do these things which were prevented before and had been clearly just waiting for an opportunity. Some are even unhappy when the Germans are not brutal enough for them.
A French Village	Body Horror	Kurt returns suffering severe burns from an attack while he was inside a tank over his right side.
A French Village	Bothering by the Book	Daniel and other French officials who don't like what's going on will be sticklers for the rules as a means of obstruction. This only somewhat works though, as a lot of times they're simply ignored.
A French Village	Bury Your Gays	
A French Village	The Bus Came Back	Kurt is shipped to the Eastern Front after it's found he was in a relationship with Lucienne, as she's French (forbidden by German military regulations). Müller is also transferred to Kiev. In a later season, both return.
A French Village	Bus Crash	Sarah gets deported along with other Jews to Poland. Later it turns out that she died in Auschwitz of typhus.
A French Village	The Butcher	Jean Marchetti is labeled "The Butcher" for his participation in a massacre within Villeneuve.
A French Village	But We Used a Condom!	Kurt expresses surprise when Lucienne gets pregnant, because he says they'd been so careful about things.
A French Village	Cain and Abel	Daniel and Marcel are very much opposites. Daniel is bourgeois: a doctor, deputy mayor (then mayor when his superior dies) and moderate politically. Marcel is a manual laborer, Communist activist and committed to the revolution. The pair are also very different in temperament. Daniel is far more calm, temperate and very tolerant about others' actions. Marcel is hot-headed, quite reckless and holds deep grudges.
A French Village	Carpet of Virility	Daniel has a full chest of hair, as seen when he's lying beside Sarah once after they've had sex.
A French Village	Cassandra Truth	
A French Village	Category Traitor	All collaborators, naturally, are viewed as traitors by French Resistance groups. Many are punished for treason as the war ends, whether after trials or with summary execution.
A French Village	The Cavalry	Müller and Hortense are rescued by American soldiers before he's about to be shot by SS border guards for desertion (with her condemned for being with him) who arrive Just in Time.
A French Village	Cessation of Existence	Discussed by Marcel and Philippe in prison. The former believes in this, while the latter insists there must be something more.
A French Village	Child of Forbidden Love	Kurt and Lucienne's child, due to him being a soldier in the German occupation, while she's French (people view such relationships very dimly).
A French Village	Chummy Commies	The Communists are portrayed, if not wholly positively (they can be quite ruthless, and many rigidly follow the Party line even when it's misguided) at least somewhat sympathetically. However, many non-Communist characters dislike them greatly. This isn't entirely unjustified as, while on the "good" side, they are still ruthless, wishing to take control over the entire Resistance and later France.
A French Village	Les Collaborateurs	The French government officials collaborate, mostly not out of any sympathy for the Germans, but to protect their people. Businessmen like Raymond also work with the Germans, though again not from sympathy and he tries to help Jewish businessman Crémieux whose company is being seized. Others however like those from the Vichy regime are enthusiastic collaborators in many cases. Sarah though tells Daniel that honest, good people such as him who collaborate aid others who aren't, since the evil ones couldn't do it without their help. He's visibly shaken by her statement.
A French Village	Cyanide Pill	A captured French resistance fighter uses a hidden cyanide capsule to kill himself with Daniel's (very reluctant) help rather than be tortured into giving up information.
A French Village	Deliberate Values Dissonance	The series showcases attitudes common in 1940s France. For instance, many French people are antisemites, with officials happily helping strip Jews of their property and rights. Lucienne's father also thanks Jules for marrying her, because being a single mother would dishonor their family. Homosexuality is also viewed pretty negatively, with De Kervern initially suspecting Jérôme murdered his lover Louis because he asserts "crimes of passion are common among queers". Lucienne, though very sweet usually, reacts quite negatively to learning Marguerite is a lesbian, saying "people like you" should be locked up and fearing she's a danger to the underage girls they teach. Many men don't like taking orders from women either, or express disbelief when they find they're in positions of authority.
A French Village	Disappeared Dad	Jean Marchetti relates that he didn't have a father growing up, so he's determined to be in his son's life. However, as his son's mother is a Jew (plus their boy, by Nazi racial laws) they must flee for Switzerland. Then after they meet again, she doesn't want Jean around and he's also a wanted fugitive, so this doesn't really work out.
A French Village	Disproportionate Retribution	The Germans take twenty people hostage, to shoot in retaliation for just one of their officers being killed if the killers don't surrender. Daniel manages to get it reduced, but it's still ten who they shoot. In other places, it's mentioned they shot fifty hostages for such attacks. Later they up the count to 100 hostages for each German killed. However, Müller admits it's only driving more people to join the Resistance.
A French Village	Draft Dodging	There's a non-military example with many young Frenchmen running off to avoid forced labor in Germany which they're conscripted into.
A French Village	Dressing as the Enemy	Some resistance fighters in gendarmes' uniforms stop a German truck to seize the arms they think it's carrying (however, it was actually transporting soldiers, causing a shootout).
A French Village	Driven to Suicide	Mrs. Cohen killed herself after Judith (at the end of her rope too) said she couldn't see her daughter due to being "hysterical". Another Jewish couple also killed themselves after learning they would be going to Poland. Josephine, Raymond's second wife, throws herself from a window after she's threatened by the police.
A French Village	Even Evil Has Loved Ones	Müller, despite torturing suspects and acting otherwise ruthless, seems to genuinely love Hortense. However, then he's willing to torture her so Daniel will talk, making it possibly subverted. From his attitude though he may not view it as contradictory, just a part of his job.
A French Village	Everyone Has Lots of Sex	Every main character pretty much gets at least one sex scene, or more often multiple ones, to varying degrees of explicitness, along with minor characters.
A French Village	Face Death with Dignity	While facing the firing squad, the Milice members begin singing their song until they get shot, shaking the executioners with this display.
A French Village	Faking the Dead	Marcel helps Suzanne fake her death when he's ordered to kill her.
A French Village	Fanservice Extra	A French prostitute and a German soldier have sex pretty explicitly while Marcel sneaks into the room to steal the man's gun.
A French Village	Final Solution	Knowledge of the Holocaust slowly builds, with a few characters knowing or believing Jews are being killed in the East initially, then more realizing over time.
A French Village	Forbidden Love	
A French Village	Forced to Watch	Antoine and Suzanne can only watch helplessly from hiding while a resistance fighter is killed along with his family by the Milice (being heavily outgunned, there is nothing they can really do).
A French Village	Functional Addict	Müller is addicted to morphine he uses for dealing with the pain of an old war injury. Usually he's fine, but when his supply is cut off he struggles greatly.
A French Village	Give the Baby a Father	Jules proposes marriage to Lucienne so that her baby can have a father, after Kurt is being sent East. She accepts.
A French Village	Good Girls Avoid Abortion	Lucienne's priest warns against having an abortion, saying that is unforgivable, but this is treated neutrally by Marie, Judith and Henri (the first two initially help her). When she tries to induce one herself though it fails and she's injured doing so. Daniel refuses to perform one, so she continues her pregnancy. Rita also decides to have an abortion immediately, then changes her mind at Jean's suggestion.
A French Village	Grey-and-Grey Morality	Neither the French nor the Germans are saints. While the French are of course shown as in the right to resist the German occupation, they're also brutal, corrupt, etc., just like the Germans.
A French Village	Happily Married	Jules and Lucienne grow into a happy couple after their marriage (initially to save her from being an unwed mother). Unfortunately, in Season 6 things get bad with them.
A French Village	Heroic Sacrifice	
A French Village	Heroic Suicide	A French resistance fighter kills himself, since otherwise he'd be tortured into giving up people who would be killed later themselves.
A French Village	Heteronormative Crusader	Lucienne gets quite upset when she learns Marguerite's a lesbian, telling her she thinks people like her should be locked up, and fears she's a danger to children. She gets over this quickly though, then apologizes and sleeps with Marguerite.
A French Village	Hollywood Atheist	Müller states he doesn't believe in God at one point, while he's quite the brutal agent with the Nazi German SD, torturing suspects regularly. Judith, however, is a good character and says she's not a believer, along with Jules. Mr. Cohen is an atheist too and portrayed quite sympathetically.
A French Village	Honey Trap	Marguerite seduces a German soldier to get his key for the radio room so Lucienne will sabotage it.
A French Village	Hooker with a Heart of Gold	Natacha, a prostitute who Henri meets, not only is a very nice woman, but also risks her life to aid a resistance group by gathering information on the Germans.
A French Village	Hypocrite	Daniel calls out a man who calls him a collaborator for denouncing a Jewish neighbor of his to the Germans-a far worse collaboration, given the Jews' fate.
A French Village	I Have Your Wife	Müller regularly detains people's relatives, then uses threats against them so they'll talk.
A French Village	The Immodest Orgasm	Hortense gets quite loud while having sex with Müller, shouting "Encore! Encore!" at him.
A French Village	Inappropriately Close Comrades	Marcel and Suzanne become a couple, despite relationships between members being forbidden under Communist Party regulations.
A French Village	Informed Judaism	We get no indication that Sarah Meyer or Judith Morhange are Jewish aside from being identified as such, though Sarah's last name is common among Ashkenazim and they both have traditional Jewish first names (though they're not uncommon for Christians too). We never seen any sign they practice Judaism (of course, many European Jews were secular or even converted Christians at the time). The same goes for the Jewish family who flee and the Crémieuxes. Judith at least says she's not a believer, and thus Jewish in only the ethnic or cultural sense.
A French Village	Interrupted Suicide	Jean Marchetti comes home and finds Eliane tried to hang herself in guilt at Josephine's death. He saves her though before it's too late.
A French Village	La Résistance	Multiple resistance groups are seen, with tactics ranging from just printing dissident flyers to assassinating Germans.
After Midnight	Fish out of Water	This is the persona that the very German Flula Borg usually runs with in his appearances.
A French Village	Irony	Müller relates to a horrified Hortense that he'd made Jews dig their graves before being shot in the Soviet Union, specifically one who obeyed him with alacrity and dug very well, wondering just why the man did that so willingly. He's caught later trying to sneak into Germany with false papers after deserting, and the SS guards make him dig his own grave too (very willingly, in terror). Müller presumably answered his own question about whatever the man's reasons were before he gets rescued.
A French Village	Jack Bauer Interrogation Technique	Torture is regularly used against suspects in German custody, both physical (beating, burning with lit cigarettes) and psychological (threats against their loved ones).
A French Village	Just Following Orders	A lot of French officials excuse themselves for collaborating this way, along with Germans.
A French Village	Kangaroo Court	Jules promises the group of Milice a fair trial so they'll surrender, and honestly tries to deliver. However, most of the judges are obviously biased against them from the start, then he's ordered by his superior to insure all of them are shot as an example to other Milice who have been shooting people in different places without trial. Their defense attorney, Daniel, is overruled no matter how much merit his objections have, as they also limit considering each case to merely fifteen minutes. As a compromise, they acquit four, but convict all the rest and give them the death sentence, carried out on the next day without appeal. The Milice members themselves recount how they gave a group of Communists a show trial too.
A French Village	Karma Houdini	Müller, a brutal SS officer who'd tortured and murdered French resistance fighters along with participating in massacres of Soviet Jews, escapes all charges. He's let off because the US wants information he has, and last seen in Paraguay, aiding the Paraguayan dictatorship in the same methods he had used to torture prisoners during the 1960s.
A French Village	Kavorka Man	Raymond is not very handsome, nor particularly charming. Nonetheless, he has no trouble getting attractive women, from his wife to Marie and even his housekeeper, who practically throws herself at him when he's even less appealing (down with an injury from being shot). They marry after Raymond's wife divorces him.
A French Village	Law of Inverse Fertility	
A French Village	Lipstick Lesbian	Marguerite, who's feminine as the next woman per 1940s French standards, it turns out is a lesbian, having a photo of her girlfriend under her pillow. Lucienne it turns out is more of a lipstick bisexual, since she's equally feminine and sleeps with Marguerite but her other relationships were with men.
A French Village	The Loins Sleep Tonight	Antoine can't perform when he's seduced by Suzanne (it's also his first time). She assures him it's common, and neither really minds.
A French Village	Lonely Funeral	Only Gustave, Daniel and Suzanne come to Marcel's funeral.
A French Village	Making Love in All the Wrong Places	Maria has casual sex with a resistance fighter in the forest.
A French Village	Man Bites Man	Hortense bites a nurse while in a panic inside the psychiatric hospital.
A French Village	Mercy Kill	Kurt asks Jules to kill him and escape his pain that way. Jules does kill him eventually, though it's unclear if it was for this or simple jealousy/revenge as Kurt slept with his wife.
A French Village	Minion with an F in Evil	Alban was essentially roped into joining the Milice, the Vichy French State Sec, to avoid his forced labor in Germany. He obeyed his godfather's order to murder two children, but loathes himself for it. Alban only did this because he was taught to obey him from childhood.
A French Village	Mirroring Factions	The French Resistance later hang and shoot people without trial, just like the Germans.
A French Village	The Mistress	Three adulterous relationships on the show are long-term:
A French Village	Modesty Bedsheet	After their failed attempt to have sex, Suzanne is shown with the sheet around her breasts, but Antoine is lying bare-chested beside her.
A French Village	Morning Sickness	Rita vomiting after eating eggs in the morning is the first sign she's pregnant.
A French Village	Mrs. Robinson	
A French Village	Ms. Fanservice	
A French Village	Nice Guy	Jules is a cheerful, friendly man whose compassion drives him to help Lucienne by marrying her, join the Resistance and aid imprisoned Jews in escaping. Lucienne, who he marries, is also (mostly) very sweet (though she has bad moments). They fit well together.
A French Village	"Not So Different" Remark	
A French Village	Obliviously Evil	Müller is too absorbed with his story, hardened from his experience or indoctrinated into thinking it's fine to even notice Hortense's horror at hearing him describe how he supervised mass murders of Jews in the Soviet Union. He doesn't appear to realize that casually propositioning her once he's finished would offend her either.
A French Village	Occupiers Out of Our Country	Driving the Germans out of France naturally is the French Resistance's motive.
A French Village	Outdoor Bath Peeping	Antoine and his friends see a young Frenchwoman bathing naked in the river, whom they spy on with binoculars. Then they realize she's with a German, and decide to take his gun.
A French Village	Pay Evil unto Evil	The Milice were so vicious that most resistance fighters have no desire to hold fair trials of them. Most are just shot upon capture without a trial at all, with the rest given a show trial and then shot. It's noted that the Milice did both these things commonly themselves.
A French Village	Pet the Dog	Jean largely helps the Vichy French and Germans in rounding up Jews or resistance fighters. Once, however, after he falls in love himself with a Jewish woman, he helps two Jews to escape.
A French Village	Playing Sick	Hélène is counseled to fake meningitis and so escape from the makeshift prison for Jews. Later, Lucienne also fakes some problem with her baby so Gestapo agents leave the house. However, it doesn't fool them entirely-they hang around to nab Hélène after she leaves the house.
A French Village	Police Brutality	Both the French and German police beat people or torture them routinely.
A French Village	Pragmatic Villainy	Müller stops the French gendarmes from raiding a resistance group and simply killing them not out of compassion but since he wants them alive to answer questions. Most are later killed despite this though as they try to escape.
A French Village	Public Execution	The Germans and the Milice shoot or hang numerous people publicly as an example to others. Later, the Resistance after the Liberation start the same thing in reprisals.
A French Village	Rape as Drama	Müller rapes Lucienne offscreen when she appeals for his help.
A French Village	Rape Discretion Shot	As Müller begins to force himself on Lucienne, things fade out.
A French Village	Reasonable Authority Figure	
A French Village	The Revolution Will Not Be Civilized	After the Liberation, the French Resistance start making reprisals against collaborators, usually without bothering to hold trials. These range from extrajudicial executions to shaving women's heads for sleeping with Germans and publicly shaming them.
A French Village	Sadistic Choice	Daniel has to decide which of two people will be shot after he's negotiated a reduction of the hostages with Kollwitz. Along with Sauvier he was also forced to pick ten people who would be shot, or twenty died instead.
A French Village	Scapegoat	After the Resistance manage to openly march through Villeneuve for the Remembrance Day celebrations, Philippe gets sentenced to death by the Germans for not preventing it (despite him being a fervent, loyal collaborator who tried as best he could).
A French Village	Secret Police	The SD (the SS's intelligence service) is a menacing presence under Heinrich Müller in Villeneuve, ruthlessly hunting down and torturing resistance members. Conversely, the French RG were already around before investigating Communists, and continue their work into the war as collaborators. Later, the Gestapo appear, hunting down Jews.
A French Village	Secret Relationship	Due to the stigma against French people involved with the German occupiers, both Lucienne and Hortense try to hide the fact they're seeing Germans, though some people still find out (it's also forbidden by German military regulations).
A French Village	Sex for Services	Hortense performs oral sex on Marchetti offscreen to get his help on Daniel's behalf, who's been imprisoned by Müller.
A French Village	Sexless Marriage	Hortense mentions to Daniel that they haven't been having sex for a while. He rebuffs her advance, and this seems to be the reason she cheats on him.
A French Village	Sexy Discretion Shot	Most of the time when two characters are about to have sex, there's a cutaway. Exceptions exist though (such as with Hortense and Müller).
A French Village	Shot at Dawn	
A French Village	Slut-Shaming	Frenchwomen known or suspected to have had sex with Germans get publicly denounced as sluts and whores (whether or not they were actually promiscuous).
A French Village	Smoking Hot Sex	Müller smokes after having sex with Hortense once. Raymond does the same thing after he has sex with Marie in his car.
A French Village	The Social Darwinist	The Milice leader Janvier gives his godchildren a hammy speech expressing his views, saying humans are animals living by one law: dominate or be dominated. In order to dominate, he says they must do terrible things, and blames his side's defeat on not doing enough of them.
A French Village	Sociopathic Soldier	Janvier, the Milice leader, gleefully orders the whole family of a resistance fighter murdered, referring to this as great fun.
A French Village	State Sec	The SS appear more than once, mostly in the form of their intelligence arm, the SD. Later the Milice, who served as this for Vichy France, also appear. Both groups have an infamous (deserved) notoriety as brutal, vicious enforcers of their regimes.
A French Village	Stay in the Kitchen	De Kervern dislikes women in France gaining greater status, complaining over them getting voting rights. He admits they did help greatly in the Resistance, but says the time has passed and they should go back into domestic life, not wanting them in politics, sports etc.
A French Village	The Stoic	Daniel, Marie and Raymond are all largely composed, showing pretty limited emotion most of the time. All have moments when their resolve breaks. In Daniel's case, it takes being tortured, while Marie's comes only when she faces her death.
A French Village	Straight Gay	Louis and Jérôme, who turn out to be a couple. Neither acts or looks differently from the straight men.
A French Village	Take That!	Geneviève is told by the US Army Colonel that one of the soldiers who attacked her will be hanged... the one who had not committed rape, because he's Black, which he freely admitted was due to American racism. Antoine is very disgusted by this, saying it's a joke for the US to say it represents freedom and democracy while they do such things.
A French Village	Tap on the Head	Twice Marie is knocked out by being pistol-whipped, in close succession. In both cases, she's shown as fine afterward.
A French Village	Those Wacky Nazis	Müller is the cultured warrior type, an SS officer with the SD who enjoys music, fine wine, beautiful women and often waxes philosophical.
A French Village	Time Skip	In Season 7, the last the show had, characters are shown much later, from the 50's into the 2000s.
A French Village	Token Religious Teammate	While other characters mention believing in God or otherwise holding religious beliefs, Lucienne is really the only one who's shown to be a believer, praying and confessing her sins as a highly devoted Roman Catholic.
A French Village	Torture Always Works	Müller regularly claims this to his victims before beginning, saying it's just a matter of time and technique before people talk. Generally it seems to be the case, but in one case he's thwarted when a Communist who's aware he has a weak heart dies after he'd held out.
A French Village	Torture Technician	Müller specializes in torture, it seems, and displays his skill frequently.
A French Village	Traumatic Haircut	Hortense gets her head shaved as the punishment for having sex with a German.
A French Village	Two-Faced	Kurt looks like this due to burns he suffered during combat on the right half of his body, including his face.
A French Village	Your Terrorists Are Our Freedom Fighters	The Germans call all resistance fighters terrorists. Most are never actually shown to engage in what people would usually call terrorism, and even assassinating Germans is likely sympathetic for many. However, even if their cause is just, resistance fighters can still be quite brutal.
A French Village	Villainous Rescue	Müller gets Daniel released from prison at Hortense's request.
A French Village	Villainous Valor	The Milice, despite being fascist enforcers of the Vichy regime allied with the Nazis, show great courage when they face a firing squad, defiantly singing and shaking their executioners before they're shot.
A French Village	Vorpal Pillow	
A French Village	We ARE Struggling Together	The Communists are at first hostile toward Suzanne given she's a Socialist, whose party they consider traitors. Begrudgingly they do accept her later, then believe she's spying on them and order that she be killed. Marcel, who's tasked with this, helps her fake her death. Later, the Communists make common cause with the Gaullists for a united resistance front, but plan on taking over all other groups and then later France itself through doing so. However, with the Liberation squabbling becomes endemic.
A French Village	What Does She See in Him?	Daniel openly asks Müller what Hortense sees in him. Müller dismisses the question.
A French Village	What the Hell, Hero?	After Marcel finds out that Daniel more or less kidnapped Tequiro from his birth father, he then denounces his action (which no one before really knew about to condemn, aside from his partner in crime Hortense).
A French Village	Wicked Cultured	Müller is very intelligent, smooth, can be quite charming and loves champagne. He's also a ruthless Nazi torturer and mass murderer.
A French Village	Would Hit a Girl	The French and German police show no compunctions toward hitting or even torturing anyone because they're women.
A French Village	Wouldn't Hit a Girl	Blanchon, the Milice leader, will shoot innocent civilians, but not women. He says it's a matter of principle as a gentleman.
A French Village	Would Hurt a Child	In the first episode, a German fighter plane shoots at a group of French school children on a field trip with their teachers, killing and wounding several. However, they may have been mistaken for soldiers and this was accidental, it's never made clear. Later Milice leader Janvier orders his godson Alban to murder a resistance fighter's children. He does, and loathes himself for it.
Adolescence	Alone with the Psycho	In Episode 3, Briony has a private conversation with Jamie, who has been creditably accused of a gruesome murder and linked to the misogynistic "manosphere." Downplayed in that Victor is observing security footage of the interview and Frank stands by the door ready to intervene. Inverted in that when Frank offers to stay in the room after Jamie loses his temper, Briony flatly refuses the offer.
Adolescence	Artistic License – Law	In reality is it likely everything said by  Ryan after he is chased down, confronted and "questioned" without a lawyer, appropriate adult or a body-worn video recording by DI Bascombe in Episode 2 would be deemed non PACE compliant and therefore inadmissible. However it is mentioned in Episode 3 he is also charged with conspiracy to murder. Considering the time jumps between episodes, though, it's also possible that more evidence was discovered that implicated him regardless of what he said.
Adolescence	Artistic License – Law Enforcement	Despite being accused of  stabbing someone to death with a knife, it is unlikely authority would be given for a team of police Armed Response Officers to lead the house raid and arrest of  Jamie, a very slight single 13-year-old boy.
Adolescence	As You Know	Jamie and Briony refer to the conversations they had in their earlier sessions in detail to compensate for the fact that the audience only sees the last one.
Adolescence	Black-and-Grey Morality	Downplayed.  Even though Katie somewhat started a bullying campaign against Jamie after he asked her out, it is repeatedly made clear that this was in no way comparable to what he did to her.
Adolescence	The Bully	Episode 2 introduced Fredo, a school bully, trying to take lunch money from Adam, DI Bascombe's son. A teacher steps in to stop it.
Adolescence	Chekhov's Gun	In episode 3, the cup of hot chocolate that Briony prepares for Jamie initially appears as just a nurturing gesture. However, it later becomes a powerful visual symbol when Jamie sends it flying across the room during one of his violent outbursts.
Adolescence	Conspiracy Theorist	The kid at the hardware store is one, and possibly an incel too. He tells Eddie that he "knows" Jamie didn't kill Katie as the stab wounds apparently don't match - despite the fact that Jamie is seen on CCTV doing it.
Adolescence	Defacement Insult	Eddie's van is vandalized with the misspelled slur "NONCE" (incorrectly written as "NONSE"), a British slang term for "sex offender".
Adolescence	Downer Ending	Katie is dead, with Jamie's future looking grim as he pleads guilty to her murder. His family must live on with the regret, pain, and guilt of losing him and of what he has done, while suffering frequent harassment due to Jamie's crime. The only silver lining is DI Bascombe reevaluating his parental methods due to the case, resolving to be more present in his son's life.
Adolescence	Driving Question	The mystery is solved in the first episode because Jamie did murder Katie but the driving question behind the series is what would drive him to kill her and what environmental factors pushed him into radicalization.
Adolescence	Epic Tracking Shot	In the climactic moments of episode 2, the camera follows Jade as she walks toward a set of traffic lights. Just before she crosses the road, the camera lifts skyward, soaring high above the urban landscape. It glides nearly half a mile across rooftops and streets before descending again near the murder site, where Eddie is seen solemnly placing flowers at the memorial.
Adolescence	Fictional Counterpart	
Adolescence	First-Episode Twist	The end of the first episode reveals that despite all of his convincing-sounding denials, Jamie did kill Katie.
Adolescence	Freeze-Frame Bonus	There is a major hint to Jamie's guilt in the opening scene of the show. His bedroom has starry night wallpaper; when the police enter his room to arrest him, his hand is placed over a quarter moon, with his hand over the top half to simulate him being caught with a knife in his hand.
Adolescence	Left Hanging	There's a lot we don't know at the end of the series, which is arguably the point.
Adolescence	Lethal Negligence	One of the recurring themes in the series is negligence towards Jamie and how it pushed him into the incel subculture.
Adolescence	MacGuffin	The knife that Jamie used to kill Katie. Despite the fact that they have the video of Jamie killing Katie, they can't find the knife. Episode 2 reveals that the knife came from Jamie's friend Ryan.
Adolescence	Meta Twist	The mystery of  the location of the knife in episode 2 and Ryan eventually confessing to supplying it after a brief tense chase scene all seems to be the setup of a reveal that Jamie has been framed/is a patsy of some kind, but the entire thread is actually a complete Red Herring; Jamie did in fact kill Katie, and Ryan is merely only charged as an accessory. In series co-creator Jack Thorne's own words, the series is a whydunnit rather than a whodunnit.
Adolescence	Miranda Rights	The England and Wales equivalent police caution is given to Jamie when he is arrested. DI Bascombe even further advises him when they arrive in custody that given the severity of the crime he has been accused of, he should ask for a lawyer.
Adolescence	Moving-Away Ending	Discussed and averted. Throughout Episode 4, both Eddie and Manda are considering moving the family from Doncaster back to their native Liverpool. However, their daughter Lisa talks them out of it, remarking that it may calm things down for a short time, but regardless of where they move people are bound to eventually find out they are Jamie's family and the whole traumatic process will then start again.
Adolescence	Nosy Neighbour	Eileen, who lives opposite the Millers spends much of the fourth episode standing outside, watching their house with apparent interest but saying very little, much to Eddy's consternation.Eddie: You all right Eileen? You want a chair, love? Can I get you chair to rest your legs?
Adolescence	Oh, Crap!	
Adolescence	Only Bad Guys Call Their Lawyers	Subverted and discussed. After arresting Jamie, Bascombe tells him that when they arrive at the station, one of the first things he should do is to ask for is a solicitor, and also stresses that doing so won't reflect on him in any way. Though Jamie is guilty of the crime he's been accused of, it's made clear that getting a lawyer isn't what makes him look guilty.
Adolescence	Oop North	Several of the characters speak with Yorkshire accents. Eddie has a heavy Scouse accent.
Adolescence	Parental Sexuality Squick	During a drive to the hardware store with Lisa, Eddie and Manda start reminiscing about their first date at the school dance, which eventually transitions into telling the story of how the night ended with the two of them making out. Lisa is mortified at the last part.
Adolescence	Patched Together from the Headlines	The creators drew inspiration from real-life UK knife crime incidents involving teenagers. While not based on any single person or event, Baumbach acknowledged in interviews that these disturbing news stories informed the show's exploration of adolescent violence and moral development. This creative approach allows the series to examine societal issues through fiction while maintaining distance from specific tragic incidents.
Adolescence	Private Profit Prison	Standling Secure Training Centre, the youth detention facility where Jamie is held, is run by the private company G70 (a stand-in for G4S).
Adolescence	Rape Is a Special Kind of Evil	Invoked by Jamie, who stalked Katie with a kitchen knife and stabbed her to death. But he points out to Briony that he didn't sexually assault her when he had an opportunity, like "most boys" would've – "So that makes me better. Don't you think?"
Adolescence	"Ray of Hope" Ending	Jamie and his family's lives are irreversibly changed by what he did, but they're still managing to pull together in an attempt to put the pieces back together. DI Bascombe resolves to become a more attentive parent to his own son after his experience dealing with Jamie, hopefully ensuring he doesn't end up falling down the same dangerous rabbit hole Jamie went down.
Adolescence	Real Time	Every episode takes place in a single shot, meaning that both time and space are continuous, without breaks or cuts.
Adolescence	Silent Credits	Episode 2 ends with schoolyard sounds playing over the credits instead of music.
Adolescence	Social Media Is Bad	Jamie's unregulated internet access and exposure to online bullying and other harmful perspectives is to blame for his radicalization.
Adolescence	Sucky School	When visiting Brentwood Academy in Episode 2, both DI Bascombe and DS Frank remark that the school seems to be chaotic and running amok, with not much learning going on at all because the teachers either can't maintain order in their class, or are too unmotivated to teach anything beyond having the kids watch documentary videos. DS Frank correctly notes that it's more of a glorified holding cell for teenagers than a place of learning.
Adolescence	Surveillance as the Plot Demands	Justified, as the story is taking place in a city in Britain, a country infamous for being some of the most surveilled places in the world.
Adolescence	SWAT Team	A team of Authorised Firearms Officers lead the raid on the Miller household in Episode 1. It shakes them up considerably (with  Jamie wetting himself when they arrest him), especially given the lack of prevalence of firearms, even used by police, in the UK.
Adolescence	Sympathy for the Devil	Zig-Zagged. Although Jamie doesn't deserve it for killing Katie for such a trivial reason, the series shows and explains how he fell into the incel community after being severely neglected by his family and educators and being bullied by the other kids in school.
Adolescence	Take That, Audience!	A quite subtle one in episode 4: when Eddie is accosted by the employee at the hardware store about posts he'd seen online regarding Jamie's case, it's very likely – though not confirmed – that this could represent viewers speculating whether Jamie actually did it to avoid asking the more uncomfortable questions about society's role in the case if he did it (which he did).
Adolescence	Teens Are Monsters	
Adolescence	Time Skip	Each episode employs a significant forward leap in the timeline, allowing the narrative to track the long-term consequences of the murder case.
Adolescence	Trashy True Crime	The kid that Eddie meets at the hardware store claims to know from "photos he's seen on Facebook" that Jamie didn't kill Katie (despite the fact that he did) and encourages him to crowdfund a defence.
Adolescence	Wham Shot	
Adolescence	What Happened to the Mouse?	We don't find out if Ryan is found guilty for his role in the murder, or if Jade is charged or expelled for attacking Ryan. The last we see of Jade is her walking away from school, lost and bereft.
Adolescence	Where Did We Go Wrong?	Eddie and Manda have this discussion in the last episode with regards to Jamie.
Adolescence	Your Approval Fills Me with Shame	In the final episode, when young hardware store employee Quint expresses support for Jamie, implying that he was somehow being framed. Eddie is clearly uncomfortable with him, and exits the store as quickly as he can.
A Different World	Affectionate Nickname	"Chipmunk" and "Pookie" for Dwayne. He often refers to Whitley as "Bunny".
A Different World	Agony of the Feet	Whitley doesn't exactly wear the most comfortable shoes and in some episodes she's either complaining about her aching tootsies or asking the nearest person for a foot massage.
A Different World	Alliterative Name	
A Different World	All Love Is Unrequited	Freddie has a huge crush on Dwayne when she first arrives at Hillman, but between him pining for Denise, dating Suzanne, and trying to attract Whitley's attention, poor Freddie doesn't even stand a chance. She eventually realizes this and moves on.
A Different World	All Men Are Perverts	Or rather, all men named Ron Johnson and not Shazza Zulu, as far as Freddie is concerned. It doesn't help Ron's case that he lives and breathes this trope, though.
A Different World	...And 99¢	After becoming tipsy on cheap wine while celebrating her 21st birthday, Whitley states that she would never again buy a wine whose price ended in this trope.
A Different World	Ascended Extra	
A Different World	The B Grade	Maggie, Kim, and Dwayne are classic overachievers, and proud of it. So is Freddie, if it's something pertaining to creative writing, African-American studies, or law.
A Different World	Babies Ever After	Whitley learns that she's pregnant in the series finale.
A Different World	Back for the Finale	Walter.
A Different World	Stern Teacher	Col. Taylor (AKA. "Dr. War"). Dwayne (after he becomes an adjunct), Whitley, and Dr. Barnabus Foster also count.
A Different World	Belligerent Sexual Tension	"Dwitley", even after they become an Official Couple. Compare how Whitley and Dwayne sometimes tend to treat each other (snarky, sarcastic, dismissive, and in Dwayne's case, borderline controlling) to how Dwayne is with Denise/Suzanne/Kinu and how Whitley treats Julian/Byron (always loving, polite, and affectionate). Nevertheless, they love each other dearly.
A Different World	Betty and Veronica	Dwayne (Archie), Whitley (Veronica), and Kinu (Betty) in season 4.
A Different World	Beware the Nice Ones	Dwayne can be absolutely terrifying when he's pissed off. Messing with his computer or his girl have been shown to bring it out of him. Even Whitley herself isn't immune to it if she's done something incredibly stupid (like charging $700 to his credit card without permission) or has worked his last nerve.Dwayne (recounting The Rashomon to Terell): "Last year, me and Ron got into it with some locals at a football game. They wanted static, we gave it to them. If I'd been packing heat that day, I would have wasted all of them, even the nice ones!"
A Different World	Big Brother Mentor	Walter filled this role neatly, both as a coach and as a Dorm Director.
A Different World	Bittersweet Ending	The two-part series finale. Dwayne lands a lucrative position with Kineshiwa thanks to an idea for a literary video game that he and Ron brainstormed, but this means he and Whitley will have to relocate to Japan, leaving their friends, families, and all they've ever known behind. Furthermore, he and Ron have a falling out over Ron not getting credited/compensated for the idea, to the point that they avoid each other and Ron actually considers legal action against his best friend. They eventually patch things up but not until the very end, when Dwayne is headed for the airport. Topping off the "-sweet" end, though, Whitley learns she's pregnant with their first child and Dwayne names Ron the godfather right before they leave.
A Different World	Black Gal on White Guy Drama	Briefly, when Freddie's cousin Matthew takes a shine to Kim.
A Different World	Break the Haughty	Dwayne to Whitley, frequently and sometimes cruelly.
A Different World	Breakout Character	Dwayne Wayne and Whitley Gilbert, who took on the starring roles after Denise was phased out of the show. Their on-again, off-again romance carried the show through several seasons.
A Different World	Bridezilla	Whitley becomes this as preparations for her's and Dwayne's wedding get underway, likely contributing to his cold feet and slight infidelity. She avoids this while planning her wedding to Byron and the role is taken on more by her cousin as bridesmaidzilla and mother as momzilla.
A Different World	Broke Episode	Happens enough times in the series to be a recurring theme.
A Different World	Bunny-Ears Lawyer	Freddie's a loopy flake, but dialogue indicates that she's a very good student. Ironically, she's also a law student.
A Different World	Celebrity Paradox	One scene has three students, including Dwayne, impersonating Bill Cosby while playing poker. Cosby, obviously, already exists in this reality as Cliff Huxtable so the gag doesn't make much sense. An argument could be made that they're impersonating Cliff but that's a stretch since none of these characters have ever met him.
A Different World	Celebrity Star	En Vogue, Blair Underwood, and Kris Kross, to name a few, get episode spotlights. And legends Patti LaBelle and Diahann Carroll each recur frequently as Dwayne's and Whitley's mothers.
A Different World	Cerebus Syndrome	For a comedy spin-off of The Cosby Show, this one took on its share of unpleasant real-life issues, such as date rape, racial tensions, the AIDS epidemic, being sent off to war, sexual harassment, and domestic/dating abuse.
A Different World	Character Development	Whitley becomes less and less of a Rich Bitch as the series goes on. Inverted with Dwayne, however, who goes from being a Dogged Nice Guy to Denise in season one to becoming controlling and somewhat neglectful to Whitley by Season 4. Played straight after he nearly loses her to Byron, though.
A Different World	Chuck Cunningham Syndrome	
A Different World	Clingy Jealous Girl	Whitley
A Different World	Content Warnings	Two episodes sported warnings before they aired, one dealing with date rape, and one dealing with the incipient AIDS crisis.
A Different World	Conveyor Belt Video	In the second Title Sequence, the camera trucks right, showing the main characters reading non-descript blue books. As the motion continues, we slide to other rooms, in which various secondary characters get brief Establishing Character Moments such as girls prettying themselves up, a marching band annoying the hell of an overworked woman, a Love Interests flirting, a team playing basketball, people dancing, a girl chatting in the phone, military personnel saluting, and graduates celebrating.
A Different World	Cool Big Sis	Jaleesa.
A Different World	Cousin Oliver	Col. Taylor's son Terrance was added to the cast in Season 4. The new class, Lena, Gina, Terrell, Dorian, and Charmaine (Cousin Pam's friend from The Cosby Show) were added in Seasons 5 and 6.
A Different World	Darker and Edgier	Unlike its parent series, this series was not afraid to tackle some pretty dark subject matter, including date rape, AIDS, the Gulf war and racial issues, and not in the light and fluffy way that The Cosby Show tended to handle them (when they talked about them at all). Black culture at the time was also more generally reflected, with characters rapping and dressing in gold chains, etc. It also wasn't afraid to openly state that its young, unmarried characters were sexually active, something that was implied at best on The Cosby Show, though that topic was generally avoided.
A Different World	Date Rape Averted	Freddie, with a timely assist from Dwayne in the Season 2 episode, "No Means No".
A Different World	Deadpan Snarker	Dr. Barnabus Foster
A Different World	Death Glare	Whitley gives these out like a college professor gives pop quizzes whenever someone annoys her. The one that stands out the most is when Dwayne tells her he went out with another woman.
A Different World	Derailing Love Interests	Kinu starts out perfectly nice, but gets bitchier as time goes on. Granted, it's mostly in response to Whitley constantly inserting herself into her relationship with Dwayne.
A Different World	Disposable Fiancé	Byron Douglas, of the "Bland Perfection" variety.
A Different World	Does Not Like Men	Following her unrequited Dwayne-crush (and coincidentally, her averted Date Rape), Freddie has varying degrees of this trope but it's mostly directed at Ron. Averted if the man in question is one Shazza Zulu, however.
A Different World	Domestic Abuse	One of its Very Special Episode s focused on Gina Deveaux being abused by her rapper boyfriend.
A Different World	Suspiciously Similar Substitute	Freddie and Kim have quite a few personality traits that remind viewers of Denise/Maggie and Millie, respectively.
A Different World	Double Standard	When Whitley is sexually harassed by her boss, everyone treats her with compassion and understanding. But when Dwayne describes an identical experience that he went through during a summer internship, right down to his female boss taking him off a prized project when he filed a complaint, Kim and Whitley snap, "Who cares?". Had the roles been reversed, everyone would have blasted Dwayne for being cruel and insensitive, but the girls uncaring attitude is played for laughs.
A Different World	Downer Ending	The episode where Whitley gets sexually harassed—after an investigation is finally done, her manager keeps his job, gets a slap on the wrist and she still has to report to him.
A Different World	Early-Installment Weirdness	The show centered around Denise Huxtable and her roommates Maggie and Jaleesa. A woman named Stevie was their dorm director and Whitley was the central antagonist. She had a minion named Millie who followed her every demand. Dwayne was a nerd whose time was mainly spent hanging around Gilbert Hall hoping for a date with any of the ladies there, but who found Whitley as annoying as everyone else did. Ron and Walter were there, but not as full-time cast members, and Kim, Freddie, Col. Taylor and Mr. Gaines are nowhere to be seen. The theme song was a slow, blues-y number sung by Phoebe Snow. Come the second season, Denise, Maggie, Stevie, and Millie are gone, Jaleesa is a supporting character and voice of reason to the younger students, Whitley is now the protagonist and she and Dwayne, now a cool guy, are dating. The theme song is now much more Motown-inspired and sung by Aretha Franklin.
A Different World	Embarrassing Middle Name	Dwayne's full name: Dwayne Cleophus Wayne.
A Different World	Ethnic Menial Labor	Nearly a whole episode was devoted to a discussion on the mammy archetype after Whitley decides to dedicate an art installation to said archetype.
A Different World	Expository Hairstyle Change	Freddie goes from wearing her frizzy hair loose to in a bun or French twists when she begins law school. And even when she wears it loose, it's combed straight.
A Different World	Fake High	In the Season 2 episode, "If You Like Pilgrim Coladas", Whitley and Kim go to a bar with a fake ID and are found out when they act drunk after several of the eponymous drink, which contains no alcohol.
A Different World	Family Theme Naming	The Wayne family. In addition to Dwayne, the one Christmas Episode discusses several relatives coming to visit him, Whitley and his parents, cousin, Aunts, and Uncles named Elaine, Shane, and Dane and even a relative has a dog named Tulane.
A Different World	First Girl Wins	Subverted, as Denise is Dwayne's first true love, but after she leaves Hillman, his affections transfer to Whitley, whom he ends up marrying after dating at least two other women in between.
A Different World	Flanderization	
A Different World	Freudian Couch	Stressed-out therapist Dr. Langhorne (played by Debbie Allen) has one. Whitley lies on it during her sessions. Dr. Langhorne lies on the couch herself during a session with Col. Taylor, Jaleesa, and Terrence.
A Different World	The Friend Nobody Likes	Whitley plays with this. While she became more responsible and mature over time, she still has moments where she comes off as insufferable, even to her best friends Freddie and Kim.
A Different World	Fur and Loathing	Freddie would freak out when she saw one. Whitley learned about this the hard way when she started dating a politician and offended one of his potential supporters by wearing fur.
A Different World	Graduate from the Story	averted as once the main cast graduated, the show went on for two more seasons and showed them going to graduate school and/or working.
A Different World	Granola Girl	Freddie.
A Different World	Heel Realization	eroic BSoD: Whitley suffers both upon learning that her great, great, great grandfather was one of the few African Americans in the 19th century to own slaves.
A Different World	Huge Guy, Tiny Girl	There's Dwayne (5'11") and Denise (5'2"); Dwayne and Whitley (also 5'2"); and Freddie (5'3") and Shazza (6'2").
A Different World	Hypocrite	Shazza makes a snide comment about Kim dating a white guy. Aside from the fact that that's none of his business, given his "green eyes" that Kim herself points out, he likely has white ancestry himself. Freddie also gets one in the episode "Prisoner of Love" when her prison pen pal is actually revealed to be a journalist researching how black male ex-cons are treated when released. At the end of the episode when it's revealed, she calls a majority of the students who treated him badly hypocrites, only for him to call her one by saying that when she thought he was an ex-con that she treated him badly and gave him a coloring book just to ease her conscience/make herself feel better.
A Different World	I Drank WHAT?!	In one episode, Lena is babysitting for Jaleesa's baby while Colonel Taylor is hosting Byron's bachelor party. Ron makes pina coladas and decides to use the milk in the fridge. Cue several spit takes when Lena comes down to get the breast milk for the baby. Also counts as You're Drinking Breast Milk.
A Different World	I Have No Son!	Dwayne's mom sends a funeral wreath, complete with a note saying "Call me when you divorce "Miss Thing"" to show her displeasure at him and Whitley getting hitched and refuses to speak to him or take his calls. She gets better by the end, though.
A Different World	I Want My Beloved to Be Happy	Kinu, upon realizing that Dwayne still carries a torch for Whitley that he's not exactly trying to extinguish, chooses to leave the relationship with her dignity intact rather than fighting to win his heart anymore. Briefly played with when Dwayne concedes that Byron is better suited to give Whitley the life she needs/wants; subverted when he makes his feelings known at Whitley and Byron's wedding and she chooses to marry Dwayne instead anyway, running into his arms and leaving a stunned Byron at the altar.
A Different World	Jerkass Has a Point	Kinu's a complete bitch by the time she leaves the show, but her reason is completely legitimate—she's fed up with Whitley's constant interference in her and Dwayne's relationship and Dwayne's refusal to do anything about it.
A Different World	Just a Stupid Accent	In real life, Jasmine Guy sounds nothing like Whitley Gilbert. She has stated in interviews that she based the accent off of her third-grade teacher to emphasize the character's southern roots and affluence.
A Different World	Karma Houdini	
A Different World	Ladykiller in Love	The womanizing Ron falls hard for Kim and has to do a lot of work to convince her that he can be a one-woman man. He then proves her point by cheating on her with her best friend Freddie, though he apparently stays faithful to her.
A Different World	The Last DJ	Ron, especially in "Just Another Four Letter Word". He's so obsessed with his shaky music career and his wannabe love life, that he barely cares about getting a "real" job. This is perhaps lampshaded in the final season's opening credits; whereas his friends and colleagues all have their careers, he's seen dancing with various women.
A Different World	Later-Installment Weirdness	The sixth and final season put the heavy focus on incoming students at Hillman, (including one recurring character from the recently ended Cosby Show) after the main characters graduated, and Dwayne and Whitley married, in the previous season; Jalessa vanished from the series; the theme song was redone (again), and now sung by Boyz II Men, replacing Aretha Franklin. Freddie does a complete 180° from her hippie/flower child persona to wearing French twists and suits when she enrolls in law school (after showing no interest in this before) and she and Ron suddenly can't keep their hands off each other, despite hating each other's guts for years before.
A Different World	Like an Old Married Couple	Dwayne and Whitley have had this going on even before they started dating much less marrying each other. Likewise for Ron and Freddie.
A Different World	Long-Lost Uncle Aesop	Guest stars, including but not limited to Tisha Campbell (of Martin fame) and Sista Souljah, introduced topics such as date rape, AIDS, the Gulf War and the LA Riots to viewers and then disappeared. In regards to the Gulf War and AIDS episode, there may be an unfortunate reason why neither character was ever seen or heard from again.
A Different World	May–December Romance	Between Col. Taylor, who's served in Vietnam and has two college-aged children putting him in his late 40's at least, and Jaleesa, who while being older than her more traditional classmates is still in her late 20's.
A Different World	MRS Degree	One episode has Whitley confessing to Dean Hughes that when she initially came to Hillman, this was her plan, complete with a wedding the day after graduation and using her art history degree to pick out the right paintings to decorate the living room.
A Different World	Musical Episode	Although several of the actors sang from time to time in the series, "The Little Mister", the episode spoofing the 1992 presidential elections, counts as one of these.
A Different World	My Sister Is Off-Limits	Ron to everyone, Dwayne included, when his sister visits Hillman. A later episode has him dating Walter's niece, which Walter is none too enthused about.
A Different World	Not-So-Forgotten Birthday	They run this plot with Whitley three times (technically.) The first season, she's surprised with a cake by the main cast. Then, on her 21st b-day, she assumes everyone forgot, gets drunk, and nearly makes out with a photo of Denzel Washington, but she is given a "spinster" dinner by her dorm mates and receives some sentimental gifts from Dwayne and Julian. While not exactly the same, special mention has to go to her first birthday as Dwayne's wife, where she gets paranoid and PLANS HER OWN SURPRISE PARTY, Dwayne finds out and cancels it, gives her a crappy dinner at a diner, and bluffs her all the way home where a roomful of people surprise the crap out of her with a cake and gifts.
A Different World	Obnoxious In-Laws	Angered by Whitley mistaking her for a maid, Dwayne's mother is relentlessly nasty to Whitley throughout their relationship, despite her repeated, sincere attempts at making amends for this. It gets cranked up after Dwayne and Whitley marry, with her sending them a funeral wreath with a note that says, "Call me when you divorce Ms. Thang", then apparently holding firm to this, as Dwayne mentions that she hangs up on him every time he calls.
A Different World	Perky Female Minion	Millie. After she leaves, Kim somewhat fills the role.
A Different World	Politician Guest-Star	Season 2's "Citizen Wayne" has a guest spot by civil-rights activist and 1988 Democratic presidential nomination runner-up Jesse Jackson.
A Different World	Pretty in Mink	Whitley owned a few furs. Although she was spoiled and materialistic, they didn't disappear as she got Character Development.
A Different World	The Professor	Dr. Barnabus Foster stands out among the faculty for his eloquence and vast literary knowledge. Being portrayed by Roscoe Lee Browne helps.
A Different World	Promotion to Opening Titles	With the second season retool, recurring guests Darryl M. Bell and Sinbad were promoted to main cast members.
A Different World	Put on a Bus	When Season 2 begins, it's explained that Denise isn't coming back to Hillman for another term.
A Different World	The Rashomon	An episode in which Ron and Dwayne get into a brawl with three white students from a rival college is depicted as it really happened (both sets of students saying and doing things to provoke each other, culminating in one of the white students vandalizing Ron's car), then from Ron's point of view (showing himself and Dwayne as completely innocent and depicting the one white student who was trying to stop the incident from escalating as equally aggressive as his friends), then from the white students (claiming that Ron and Dwayne were the aggressors and omitting the damage done to Ron's car).
A Different World	Required Spinoff Crossover	Unsurprisingly, there were several with its parent series. Cliff appeared in cameos during phone conversations, while Claire, Theo, Rudy, and Grandpa Russell each visited Hillman. After Denise's departure, Claire still made appearances and Vanessa made one. In a later episode, Dwayne visits Denise (in her final appearance on the series) and meets Olivia. Lance and Charmaine also appeared in Season 5, with the latter joining the cast the next season.
A Different World	Rich Bitch	Whitley initially, although this was toned down over time.
A Different World	Ripped from the Headlines	When Whitley is sexually harassed by her boss. He chastises her for filing a complaint, telling her, "There are far too few of us (African-Americans) in the corporate world. We owe it to our people to present a united front." The incident was inspired by the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill case, right down to the criticism leveled at Hill for turning against one of her own.
A Different World	Romantic False Lead	Hoo boy. Before Dwayne and Whitley marry, he dates Denise, Suzanne and Kinu. For Whitley, there's Julian and Byron (whom she almost married). Ron dates Millie and Kim before his relationship with Freddie, who dated Ernest, Garth, and Shazza Zulu (and had a rather lengthy, if unreciprocated, crush on Dwayne) before him. Kim dated Robert, Freddie's cousin Matthew, and Ron before hooking up with her eventual fiance Spencer, and Jaleesa almost married Walter before shocking everyone and eloping with Col. Taylor.
A Different World	Runaway Bride	Whitley literally leaves fiancé Byron at the altar to run down the aisle into Dwayne's arms.
A Different World	Ship Tease	Between Dwayne and Whitley before they finally got together, even when Denise was still in the picture.
A Different World	Soapbox Sadie	Usually Freddie, but others had their turns.
A Different World	Special Guest	Includes several appearances of cast members from parent series The Cosby Show; as well as appearances from Montel Williams, Jesse Jackson, and Lena Horne.
A Different World	Spotlight-Stealing Squad	The final season was essentially "A Different World: The Next Generation", with most episodes being focused on the new freshman/sophomore class.
A Different World	Sweet Polly Oliver	In one episode, Whitley disguises herself as a guy and makes some sexist comments comparing her and other girls' "ass"-sets in an attempt to bag Dwayne for cheating or at least for entertaining the thought. He sees through it but goes along with it just to mess with her.
A Different World	Team Mom	Stevie, Lettie, Dwayne's mom (Patti Labelle).
A Different World	There Are No Therapists	Averted. Whitley sees Dr. Langhorne, played by Debbie Allen. Coincidentally, Col. Taylor, Jaleesa and Terrence are also her patients.
A Different World	Token White	Maggie in the first season, and Freddie's cousin Matthew later on.
A Different World	Took a Level in Jerkass	Dwayne and Ron started out as couple of goofy, somewhat weird, but all-around nice guys and while they pretty much remain decent throughout the entire series, 3 seasons in sees Dwayne treating Whitley far worse than he ever would have treated Denise Huxtable, even after they become an Official Couple, while Ron becomes The Casanova and pervert with only minimal Character Development in the final two seasons.
A Different World	Tsundere	Whitley to Dwayne (and she also starts getting yanderish towards him in the later seasons) and both her and Freddie to Ron—although with him, it's almost completely tsun-tsun.
A Different World	The Twelve Spoofs of Christmas	In the Season 3 Christmas Episode, the gang (minus Whitley, who is experiencing Yet Another Christmas Carol) all gathered together in the forum and sang their own parody of the song including only five verses:Mr. Gaines: Five onion rings...Col. Taylor: Four failing freshmen...Ron: Three French kisses!Kim and Freddie: Two butts-a-bumpin'...All: And my MC Hammer CD!
A Different World	Uncanny Family Resemblance	Jasmine Guy playing Whitley Gilbert and her cousin Liza in one episode.
A Different World	Uncle Tomfoolery	Ron (though he got better as the show went on). He would fit the trope if his best friend was a white guy, but Dwayne is about as far from that as the show got. Ron did have some Daffy Duck tendencies, but as time went on, he showed himself to be sincere, thoughtful, innovative, and genuine. Sure he was greedy, but given that his father was a used car salesman, he could have turned out a LOT worse.
A Different World	Unrequited Love Switcheroo	Dwayne, Whitney, and Kinu.
A Different World	Vitriolic Best Buds	Despite literally being at each other's throats in all prior interactions, Dwayne and Whitley's mothers finally hit it off in a Thanksgiving episode while languishing in a jail cell.
A Different World	Wedding Deadline	In "Save the Best for Last", Dwayne interrupts the wedding just before Whitley says "I will" to Byron, only for her to say "I do" to Dwayne, marrying him instead.
A Different World	Wham Episode	One episode had Kim's detective father (played by Richard Roundtree) coming down hard on her after she defied him to go to a concert in DC. The next episode? Kim, Whitley, Dwayne, and Freddie drive from Virginia to Ohio after finding out he was shot and possibly paralyzed.
A Different World	Where da White Women At?	Freddie's mother is white, and a handful of throwaway lines establish that Colonel Taylor's never-seen ex-wife is also. The Season 2 Valentine's Day episode has Maggie dancing with a black guy. Inverted with Kim and Freddie's cousin, Matthew.
A Different World	Why Waste a Wedding?	
A Different World	Woman Scorned	As much as she treats Dwayne like dirt when he's trying to attract her attention, Whitley readily switches into this mode when he dumps her and starts dating someone else.
A Different World	Yet Another Christmas Carol	Whitley gets put through this trope's paces in Season 3's "For Whom the Jingle Bell Tolls".
A Different World	Your Mom	Ron's penchant for "Your Mama" jokes puts him on the wrong side of Kim, until he tells her one with a genuinely sweet spin. Ron: Your Mama's daughter is so beautiful, Ron Johnson is speechless.
Adventures Of Ceratops	Artistic License – Paleontology	
Adventures Of Ceratops	Dull Surprise	Sam Hammgton's acting isn't very good nor memorable.
Adventures Of Ceratops	Eiffel Tower Effect	The Great Wall of China's the place the documentary uses to introduce Sinoceratops.
Adventures Of Ceratops	Mutual Kill	A Triceratops is fatally wounded by a Tyrannosaurus, but only collapses and dies after it has killed the predator.
Adventures Of Ceratops	Non-Indicative Name	No, the dubious genus Ceratops doesn't appear.
Adventures Of Ceratops	Raptor Attack	Velociraptor, while having feathers, also has typical broken wrists and too small wing feathers.
Adventures Of Ceratops	Temper-Ceratops	To be expected when ceratopsian dinosaurs are the focus.
A For Andromeda	20 Minutes into the Future	Set ten years on from when it was broadcast.
A For Andromeda	A.I. Is a Crapshoot	This has been designed into the computer from the beginning.
A For Andromeda	Alien Invasion	By proxy.
A For Andromeda	Artificial Human	
A For Andromeda	Bald of Evil	Intel hatchetman Herr Doktor Kaufman.
A For Andromeda	Chekhov's Gun	The fire axe installed in the computer room, used by Fleming to destroy the computer. In "Breakthrough" it's the early reference to freak weather conditions.
A For Andromeda	The Chessmaster	The computerFleming: "How did you know he would do that?"Andromeda: "It has been calculated."
A For Andromeda	Computer Equals Tapedrive	Averted. Fleming has to destroy all the components of the computer, plus the original radio message, to ensure its destruction.
A For Andromeda	Creepy Monotone	Andromeda. In "Breakthrough", Gamboule after seeing the message.
A For Andromeda	Death from Above	Britain finds itself being overflown by satellite bombs launched by an unknown power, and uses the computer to design a rocket capable of shooting them down.
A For Andromeda	Eagleland	Inverted with government officials becoming arrogant once they realise that their ownership of the computer means Britain no longer has to play second fiddle to the United States.
A For Andromeda	Giant Eye of Doom	The protoplasmic lifeform stares out of its tank with a single giant eye. Unsurprisingly the scientists call it Cyclops.
A For Andromeda	Hard-Work Montage	
A For Andromeda	Hollywood Science	Averted as Fred Hoyle is a noted astronomer, best known for his work on the understanding of the creation of the elements through stellar nucleosynthesis, for developing the steady state theory of the universe, and for coining the term "Big Bang". He already had a taste for science fiction, having written a novel The Black Cloud in 1957.
Adventures In Wonderland	A Day in the Limelight	Most episodes are focused either on Alice, the Queen, the White Rabbit, or the Hatter and Hare, but there are some exceptions:
A For Andromeda	Interface with a Familiar Face	Andromeda looks exactly like a female operator killed earlier by the computer (except she's now blonde). The computer used the woman's death to gain all the knowledge it needed to create an Artificial Human.
A For Andromeda	Is That a Threat?	eming: "Becoming quite indispensable, aren't you?"Andromeda: "Please be careful what you say."Fleming: "Is that a threat?"Andromeda: "Yes."
A For Andromeda	MegaCorp	International trading consortium Intel, which isn't too particular about its methods.
A For Andromeda	Mind Control	The computer can directly control its synthetic lifeforms, and can brainwash susceptible people. However human greed and conflict are more effective means of extending its influence.
A For Andromeda	Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!	The computer reacts to Fleming's attempts to sabotage it with increasingly hostile acts. In the sequel it's revealed that one of those acts was to create the bacteria that's going to destroy all life on Earth.
A For Andromeda	Straw Vulcan	Andromeda gradually develops emotions, and when Fleming destroys the computer admits that she hated it. When Fleming asks why she didn't help him earlier, Andromeda replies that logic is more powerful than emotion, and that humans too are bound by the logic of a situation to continue on as always, even if they hate their circumstances.
A For Andromeda	Wetware Body	Andromeda, though she works in conjuction with the computer rather than having it downloaded into her head.
A For Andromeda	What Is This Thing You Call "Love"?	Fleming explains to Andromeda the difference between right and wrong ('nasty' and 'nice') by pinching, then caressing her. Later on Fleming grabs her for a snog, though by that stage she has already started to develop emotions, including concern for his life.
A For Andromeda	You Have Outlived Your Usefulness	The computer kills Cyclops the moment Andromeda is created; our first indication that it is 'evil'.
A For Andromeda	A Child Shall Lead Them	Spoofed — Dr Dawnay is told that the ruler of Azaran is arriving, and is surprised when the door opens to admit a young boy. She starts to bow regardless...only for the real ruler, a middle-aged man, to walk through the door.
A For Andromeda	Back from the Dead	Andromeda apparently drowns after falling into a deep pool at the end of the first serial, but is shown to have survived.
A For Andromeda	Batman Gambit	Andromeda reveals at the end that the brutal nature of the first computer was deliberate so that mankind would step in and take control of it, and therefore its own destiny. Fleming suggests that bringing the world to the brink of disaster was part of its plan too.
A For Andromeda	Call-Back	When Fleming discovers that the computer has not been destroyed by the violent storms, we see him eyeing a fire axe.
A For Andromeda	Even Bad Men Love Their Mamas	Kaufman is allowed to become more human (though never to the extent of doing a Heel–Face Turn); in the first serial he's more of a Smug Snake.
A For Andromeda	Hollywood Silencer	The bowler-hatted Intel assassin uses a .25 Beretta with a miniscule silencer that makes so little sound it can be covered by a camera flash.
A For Andromeda	Improperly Placed Firearms	The British soldiers who recapture Fleming carry World War II Lee Enfield bolt-action rifles and a German MP40 submachine gun (the soldiers in the first serial are correctly armed with L1A1 self-loading rifles).
A For Andromeda	Just Friends	Fleming on his relationship with Andromeda (though he kisses her at the end)."We are what is popularly known as just friends."
A For Andromeda	Qurac	Azaran, a newly-independent Middle Eastern country which hopes to use the computer to resolve its agricultural problems.
A For Andromeda	Reluctant Mad Scientist	Scientists are lured to Azaran by Intel under various pretexts, whereupon they discover You Can Never Leave.
A For Andromeda	Shell-Shocked Veteran	The hermit, implied by his possession of a German MP40 submachine gun and his desire to live away from human contact.
A For Andromeda	Trolling Translator	When Kaufman announces that Intel has effectively taken over Azaran, the translator shows his disapproval by talking loudly over him. Also this scene:Kaufman: "The army and all other branches will report directly to the President. The present parliament will not be called back into session. Help will continue to be provided by..."(Translator gives long stream of Arabic)Kaufman: "...a new international technological and trading consortium..."Translator: "Intel."(Kaufman glares at translator)
A For Andromeda	Truth Serum	One of Intel's tools.
A For Andromeda	Utopia Justifies the Means	The radio message warns that without intervention most intelligent life destroys itself, and the computer tries to set up a world dictatorship to avert this.
A For Andromeda	Villainous Breakdown	Gamboule goes Laughing Mad because she refuses to accept that the world is being destroyed. Eventually Kaufman locks her out on the balcony so she gets killed by a tornado.
A For Andromeda	Weather-Control Machine	The oceans are being filled with a bacteria that absorbs nitrogen, eventually killing off all plants and reducing the air pressure, reducing the ability to produce or (in animal life) absorb oxygen.
A For Andromeda	We Can Rule Together	While not stated in those terms, that is what Andromeda offers Fleming. When he says he's not interested, the computer takes over Intel director Gamboule instead.
A For Andromeda	Well-Intentioned Extremist	Gamboule after she sees the message sent from the Andromeda galaxy.
After Lately	"Fawlty Towers" Plot	
After Lately	Mockumentary	
After Lately	Unsympathetic Comedy Protagonist	Pretty much everybody, but particularly Chelsea herself.
Afterschool Special	Abusive Parents	A wide variety of stories — physical, verbal and sometimes sexual.
Afterschool Special	Attending Your Own Funeral	One special was an adaption of John J. Berrio's "Dead at Seventeen," stressing to teens the importance of observing safe driving rules all of the time, and that the consequences of failing to do so even once, even for a split second, could be deadly and have far more social, familial and legal consequences.
Afterschool Special	Book Burning	nd other censorship-related stories. The latter sometimes involving stories meant for publication in a school newspaper but are deemed unflattering or incriminating by the school administration (rather than unfactual). The book-banning stories usually related to a well-known work whose language (rather than the subject matter) resulted in a ban request, only for someone to invariably point out that the Bible had numerous instances of coarse language, sex, violence, etc.
Afterschool Special	Date Rape	Several specials dealing with rape and attempted sexual assault.
Adventures In Wonderland	Heterosexual Life-Partners	The Hatter and the Hare.
Afterschool Special	Death Row	A 1984 CBS Schoolbreak Special titled: "Dead Wrong: The John Evans Story," the true story of a death row inmate who went on a crime spree that ended with the murder of a pawn shop owner in view of his daughters. Evans agreed to be interviewed, with his comments providing a strong message to teenagers about making good choices, choosing good people as friends and staying away from drugs. Evans was executed in the electric chair just days after his interview was recorded, with a re-enactment shown in the closing moments of the special.
Afterschool Special	Driven to Suicide	Usually dealing with teenage suicide and its effects.
Afterschool Special	The Aggressive Drug Dealer	ugs:
Afterschool Special	Harmful to Hitchhikers	A 1983 ABC Afterschool Special called "Andrea's Story: A Hitchhiking Tragedy" was about a girl dealing with the aftermath of being raped while hitchhiking.
Afterschool Special	Missing Mom	nd Disappeared Dad: Several, including one where a non-custodial mother kidnaps her children and brainwashes them into believing their dad had died in a car accident. Another involved a young teenager who raised her younger siblings after both parents had died.
Afterschool Special	A Nazi by Any Other Name	The 1981 Afterschool Special The Wave (1981), where a high school history teacher's classroom project to illustrate the realities of Nazi Germany and fascism turns ugly. Inspired a novel and a German feature film.
Afterschool Special	Never Learned to Read	"The Hero Who Couldn't Read," about a high school basketball star who is illiterate and has friends help him with his homework ... until the day his little brother loses his eyesight after an accident at a coin-operated laundry (the tyke spilled liquid soap in his eyes, and the stud couldn't read the directions on what to do in case said situation arose).
Afterschool Special	No Fair Cheating	The Cheats is all about this.
Afterschool Special	The Quincy Punk	The Day My Kid Went Punk (ABC)
Afterschool Special	Swapped Roles	Usually involving people of different generations, the goal (as always) being both sides getting a greater understanding of the challenges faced by the other.
Afterschool Special	Teen Pregnancy	Schoolboy Father (ABC) and Babies Having Babies (CBS)
Afterschool Special	'70s Hair	
Afterschool Special	Aesop Collateral Damage	Sometimes was used to drive home the moral of the story.
Afterschool Special	Bittersweet Ending	More bitter than sweet for The Cheats, the tale of a high school cheating scandal, wherein an otherwise outstanding student is trying to get into a prestigious university:  Beth, the straight A-student, is expelled while the principal, Dr. Daniels, is forced to resign; one of the main instigators, Holly, becomes a Karma Houdini initially for getting away with cheating on her test. Then Dr. Daniels gets another administrative position and vouches for Beth at Cornell admissions, so she gets into her dream university. Beth makes it clear, however, that she will never forgive Holly for what she did.
Afterschool Special	Can't Get Away with Nuthin'	
Afterschool Special	Character Witness	In The Cheats, Dr. Daniels is harsh on Beth when confronting her about the test answers found in the library book that she checked out. She also believes Beth when Beth honestly tells her that she got her grade fairly and didn't cheat. Beth reveals in the epilogue that Dr. Daniels fought tooth and nail to get Beth into Cornell after the latter got expelled from high school.
Afterschool Special	Children Raise You	Shows up in specials like Francesca, Baby (1976) and She Drinks a Little (aka First Step) (1981). In both, a parent's alcoholism means the eldest daughter serves as head of the household, cooking, cleaning, and caring for her younger siblings.
Afterschool Special	Early-Installment Weirdness	Mainly during the first two or three seasons, which talked about more general "all-ages" issues like extinction. Some specials were even animated.
Afterschool Special	Fun with Acronyms	One special was about a girl whose boyfriend has a venereal disease. Its title was A Very Delicate Matter. Platypus Comix also suggested the alternate title A Super Totally Delicate Matter.
Afterschool Special	Heel–Face Door-Slam	Happens twice to Holly in The Cheats. She goes to Dr. Daniels to wish her goodbye on graduation, only for Dr. Daniels to tell her she knows that Holly let Beth get expelled to save her own skin, and that Holly only cheated herself. Two years later, Holly goes to catch up with Beth, who tells her that what she did was unforgivable and nothing Holly does can fix that.
Afterschool Special	I Know You Know I Know	On graduation day in The Cheats, Dr. Daniels has a frank talk with Holly before the principal has to leave. She knows that Holly cheated and can't prove it because Beth refused to give up Holly to save herself. But she tells Holly that whatever happens, Holly cheated herself and will have to live with that.
Afterschool Special	It's a Wonderful Plot	Amy and the Angel, with the twist being that the Clarence had killed himself and was forced to roam the earth for years after, before being given a second chance.
Afterschool Special	Karma Houdini Warranty	It at first seems that Holly is a Karma Houdini in that her college admissions aren't affected by the cheating scandal. Her adult self admits, however, that she is plagued by guilt that Beth ended up paying the highest price for it, and nothing she can do will fix it.
Afterschool Special	My God, What Have I Done?	
Afterschool Special	The Scapegoat	
Afterschool Special	The Show Must Go Wrong	In She Drinks a Little, Cindy, who lands the lead role in the school play, ends up embarrassed by her alcoholic mother, Miriam, during the curtain call, when Miriam walks onstage uninvited and drunkenly slurs her pride for her daughter.
Afterschool Special	This Is Unforgivable!	In the epilogue of The Cheats,  Beth consents to talk with Holly for a few minutes, two years after that fateful senior year. But that's all Holly gets for letting Beth get expelled, a few minutes. Holly tries to break the ice, only for her face to fall when Beth said she had to go to a state school for a year and was accepted into Cornell for sophomore year because Dr. Daniels kept calling admissions and vouching for her, explaining the circumstances behind the cheating scandal. Beth also says, in a rather cold but calm voice, that she's never going to forget or forgive that her best friend threw her under the bus to save her own ass while getting away with stealing test answers. She then walks away, and Holly can't bring herself to apologize.
Afterschool Special	"Too Young to Die" Lamentation	A 1992 episode was a dramatic adaptation of John J. Berrio's "Seventeen" essay, again focusing on his post-mortem reflections and promising to heed driving safety and traffic laws (as he was supposed taught to but chose instead to ignore) if God would grant him a second chance.
Agent X	From Bad to Worse	With "Pilot" when the kidnap victim was abducted to blackmail her father in the FBI. See Diplomatic Immunity for more details.
Afterschool Special	Troubling Unchildlike Behavior	One example is in The Late Great Me (1979), an adaptation of Sandra Scoppetone's 1976 novel of the same name. Geri, still only a senior in high school, starts drinking to impress a boyfriend and in very little time is drinking so heavily she's regularly blacking out and making a fool of herself in public while intoxicated.
Afterschool Special	Very Special Episode	A dramatic version thereof, in which characters dealt with such situations as abuse, alcoholism, divorce, drugs, teen pregnancy... the list was limitless!
After The War 1989	Blitz Evacuees	At the start of the story, Michael, along with the rest of St George's School, have been evacuated from Crawley Down in Sussex to the Lorna Doone Hotel on the North Devon coast.
After The War 1989	British Stuffiness	The unwritten rules of English behaviour that contribute to this attitude are a major theme throughout the series, some of which, the headmaster explains, somewhat abstractly, to Joe when he first arrives at the school:"Fair play. Not telling tales. Own up. Team before the individual. Never ganging up. Work hard, play hard and, if necessary, take your medicine like a man."
After The War 1989	Character Narrator	An adult Michael narrates the first episode, which takes place when he and Joe were still children.
After The War 1989	Kids Are Cruel	Fairfax's reaction to meeting Joe is to immediately start being an antisemitic Jerkass towards him.
After The War 1989	Shout-Out	The man driving Joe and his mother to the school in the first episode sings "By the Light of the Silvery Moon" to himself.
After The War 1989	Token Minority	When they first meet, Michael doesn't appreciate being told by the headmaster to make friends with Joe because they're the only two Jewish boys in the school.
Against The Wind	Bilingual Bonus	The Irish do drop some Irish phrases on occasion. In conversation one of the rebels can be heard discussing "the Sásanaigh", a word better known from the Outlander series. (Sásanachnote Sásanaigh, plural or Sassenach are the Irish and Scottish forms of the same word, literally meaning Saxon, but contextually just meaning "English".) The pronunciation, for instance with géanna fiáine in the first episode, can be a bit iffy, though.
Against The Wind	Deadpan Snarker	Dinny, but also Polly Macnamara, a Dubliner who was sent to Ireland with Mary.
Against The Wind	The Dragon	The foreman Jonas Pike is this to Lieutenant Greville. He is thoroughly humbled at the end of the series.
Against The Wind	Epic Fail	The convict rebellion of 1804.
Against The Wind	Evil Brit	Played with. Greville is the most prominent example of this trope, although Chester is not. The rum corps at large has some rather sinister members. In Ireland, the British troops in general are seen as this.
Against The Wind	Fighting Irish	Oh dear. The Irish rebels do the same mistakes over, and over, and over. Mary, who is a hapless witness to all this, gets more and more resentful. As it is, she ends up a Sour Supporter of the last rebellion, having witnessed too many of her friends and countrymen being soundly executed over the course of the series. Dinny is probably the most prominent example of the trope. Street smart, but foolhardy.
Against The Wind	Fire-Forged Friends	Mary and Polly after their ordeal at sea. Although theirs was a sour relationship from the beginning, Polly warmed up to Mary when she was tended to after a flogging, and they became loyal friends.
Against The Wind	Flat Joy	The Irish convicts (of course) when commanded to shout and Cheer for the king of England. Greville holds a Rousing Speech to that effect, ending it with a "Long Live the King!" The Irish respond accordingly (Yay).
Against The Wind	Great Offscreen War	The Napoleonic Wars, fought on the other side of the world.
Against The Wind	Idiot Ball	The Irish rebels - when deciding to meet the British soldiers in a head-on Assault. They are, of course, mowed down by the British soldiers.
Against The Wind	Land Down Under	Apart from the first episode, which is set in Ireland, and the second, which takes place at sea, the series is set in New South Wales.
Against The Wind	Manipulative Bitch	Louisa Chester, until her husband puts her in place. On a lower level, Polly Macnamara, although not with an evil intent. She has a manipulative trait, which is used to her advantage when she is assigned to Will Pierce.
Against The Wind	Never Learned to Read	Jonathan, until Mary came along.
Against The Wind	Oh, Crap!	Greville, when he tries to fool Jonathan after he is set free. Jonathan at this point has learned to read, and proudly reads out his letter of commission to Greville (who had tried to fool him by telling him the letter had a different content). The priceless look on his face when Jonathan reads out the letter to him is one of the more awesome moments in this series.
Against The Wind	Oireland	Dinny, Polly and Mary all speak with broad Irish accents. A point is made of making Polly sound more Dublin-like, while Mary is a farm girl from Rathcurran. It works.
Against The Wind	Penal Colony	Set during Australia's colonial era over the period 1798–1812, the series follows the life of Mary Mulvane, a daughter of an Irish school master. At 18, she is transported to New South Wales for a term of seven years after attempting to take back her family's milk cow which had been seized by the British "in lieu of tithes" to the local proctor. She endures the trial of a convict sea journey to New South Wales and years of service as a convict before her emancipation and life as a free citizen
Against The Wind	Proper Lady	Louisa Chester. She is so "proper", it is possible to use it against her. Something Greville does to hurt Mary.
Against The Wind	The Quisling	General Holt, who at first feigned support for the rebellion, but who then rode straight for the British generals and gave them advise instead.
Against The Wind	Sentenced to Down Under	Set during Australia's colonial era over the period 1798–1812, the series follows the life of Mary Mulvane, a daughter of an Irish school master. At 18, she is transported to New South Wales for a term of seven years after attempting to take back her family's milk cow which had been seized by the British "in lieu of tithes" to the local proctor. She endures the trial of a convict sea journey to New South Wales and years of service as a convict before her emancipation and life as a free citizen.
Against The Wind	Shout-Out	Dinny, when discussing rebellion, clearly states that he has nothing to lose but his chains. In this series he utters this in 1804, a good 14 years before Karl Marx was born, and a good 44 years before he actually wrote it down.
Against The Wind	Slave Liberation	What the convicts dream about, and eventually die for.
Adventures In Wonderland	Big Brother Bully	Downplayed, but still occasionally shows up with Tweedle Dee. While the Tweedles usually get along great, Dee (the tallest of the two) has this tendency to be a little too fond of teasing and pushing around his smaller brother.
Against The Wind	Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism	Discussed from the very first episode and onwards, first by Mary's father, and then by Mary herself. She gets tired of all the pointless rebellions after all, mostly because she cannot bear to see her own friends and countrymen get killed and hanged (or, as is shown on the ship to Australia) flogged to death. The constant discussion on different ways to win freedom is a classical left-wing trait.
Against The Wind	Stiff Upper Lip	This British trait is played up to show the British stuffiness - the British are all things considered both overlords and landowners in the series. Subverted with the common Englishmen Will and Jonathan. The trait is also played up to set them apart from the "unruly Irish" both in Ireland and in Australia.
Against The Wind	Too Good for This Sinful Earth	Mary. She got transported, not because of evil intent, but because she wished to help her family get their cow back. She is one of the most morally upright people in the entire series and gets everyone's respect for it.
Against The Wind	You All Meet in an Inn	The "Bird in the Barley" Inn. This place serves as a meeting place on a number of occasions, and is also the place where the rebels plan their course of action, as well as the scene for the wedding of Jonathan and Mary.
Adventures In Wonderland	Acid-Trip Dimension	Alice steps through her mirror into one Once per Episode on her way to Wonderland.
Adventures In Wonderland	Acquired Situational Narcissism	Happens to The Hare in the episode "Vanity Hare", after the Queen awards him the Smarty Pants Medal for helping her solve her crossword.
Adventures In Wonderland	Acrofatic	Though he's always shown sitting in one spot, the Caterpillar can be seen doing various athletic activities, such as lifting weights and playing basketball.
Adventures In Wonderland	Actor Allusion	
Adventures In Wonderland	Adaptational Attractiveness	The Queen, the Hatter, and especially Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee, who are sleek, athletic dancers instead of the fat little twins of tradition, and the Duchess, who goes from a Gonk to Teri Garr.
Adventures In Wonderland	Adaptational Nationality	This version of Alice is American, as opposed to English like in the books and Disney film.
Adventures In Wonderland	Adaptational Nice Guy	Pretty much every single character is much friendlier, more reasonable and more affable than their counterparts in either the original book or the movie.
Adventures In Wonderland	Adaptation Dye-Job	
Adventures In Wonderland	Adaptation Personality Change	In Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the Duchess is introduced as a nasty, child-abusing grouch in a kitchen full of irritating pepper, then reappears later as a silly, overly friendly figure who finds nonsensical morals in everything Alice says. In this series, her baby, pepper and moralizing are Adapted Out, and instead she's a caricature of a Proper Lady and a Bitch in Sheep's Clothing whose so-called friendship with the Queen consists entirely of competing with her.
Adventures In Wonderland	Adapted Out	Many characters from the original books and the Disney animated movie are omitted, such as the Dodo, Bill the Lizard, the Carpenter, and the King of Hearts.
Adventures In Wonderland	Adipose Rex	The Queen, of the Big Beautiful Woman variety.
Adventures In Wonderland	Affectionate Parody	The songs, which send up everything from country and rock to jazz and the blues.
Adventures In Wonderland	Anchovies Are Abhorrent	"Pizza de Resistance" reveals that the Queen of Hearts likes her pizza with everything on it... except anchovies. The Cheshire Cat on the other hand, being a fish-loving feline, thinks a pizza without anchovies is no pizza at all. This causes a problem at the Queen's pizza-baking contest, where the Tweedles end up being disqualified because the Cat secretly added anchovies to their pizza.
Adventures In Wonderland	And Knowing Is Half the Battle	A variation, as Alice would end most episodes discussing the day's aesop with her cat Dinah, providing the lesson in a way that wasn't disconnected from the rest of the episode. Sometimes, the lessons weren't that much of an Aesop as they were learning about something like spelling homonyms, what adverbs are, or what the compass rose symbols are.
Adventures In Wonderland	Annoying Patient	The Hatter becomes this to the Queen and the Rabbit in "The Hatter Who Came to Dinner," after he hurts his back while trimming the Queen's hedges and has to stay in bed at the palace. Made worse when he keeps Playing Sick even when his back feels better so he can keep living in luxury.
Adventures In Wonderland	Annoying Younger Sibling	Alice's younger brother Brian, who never appears onscreen, but whom she complains about often to Dinah. Alice herself also sometimes plays this role to her older sister Kathy (e.g. snooping in her room or borrowing her perfume without permission), though her adventures in Wonderland always teach her An Aesop about what she's done by the end.
Adventures In Wonderland	Anti-Escapism Aesop	"TV or Not TV" and its anti-television aesop. It's somewhat softened by the fact that both the Red Queen and the White Rabbit say that watching television is OK in moderation throughout the episode.
Adventures In Wonderland	Anxiety Dreams	In "Bunny, Can You Spare a Dime?" when the Queen thinks she's spent her entire fortune, she has a nightmare where she's forced first to take in her subjects as boarders because she needs the rent money, and then to sell her palace to the Duchess.
Adventures In Wonderland	Artistic License – Animal Care	Alice is depicted sometimes having a goldfish in a bowl with only water. This is a very bad thing to do with goldfish as it does not leave enough space. She also has it in the room with a cat - which is not a good idea. However, she only has the goldfish in her room a few times, and it's mentioned that the fish actually belongs to her brother, not to her. This suggests that it might be a temporary place while her family cleans the tank offscreen.
Adventures In Wonderland	Art Shift	Whenever the Caterpillar reads a story, it turns to claymation.
Adventures In Wonderland	Audience Participation	One activity at Epcot's AT&T Global Neighborhood, located at the exit of Spaceship Earth from 1994-2007, allowed visitors to help Alice find Dinah via a voice-activated TV.
Adventures In Wonderland	Bad "Bad Acting"	
Adventures In Wonderland	Balloon Belly	
Adventures In Wonderland	Batman Gambit	Brilliantly pulled off by the Mad Hatter in "Copy Catter Hatter" to outsmart his aptly-named titular cousin.Copy Catter Hatter: You tricked me with the ol' leave-out-the-fruit-covered-hat-design-to-be-copied-because-the-Queen-will-hate-it trick, huh?Mad Hatter: Righty-roo, while I kept a completely different design for myself!
Adventures In Wonderland	Be Careful What You Wish For	The Aesop of "The Adventures of Spectacular Man." The Hatter discovers that being a superhero means having no time for tea.
Adventures In Wonderland	Berserk Button	Do NOT imply the Caterpillar's stories aren't original unless you want to face his wrath.
Adventures In Wonderland	Big, Fat Future	In "Bah Hamburger," the Ghost of Nutrition Yet to Come shows Tweedle Dum that if he doesn't get his junk food habit under control, he'll become so enormous and round that he has to be rolled from place to place, and abandoned when his friends go to play games.
Adventures In Wonderland	Big Fun	
Adventures In Wonderland	The Big Guy	Tweedle Dee. Though not particularly large or imposing, he and his brother are by far the most athletic characters, but Dee is clearly the bigger and stronger of the two, which occasionally frustrates Dum.
Adventures In Wonderland	Bitch in Sheep's Clothing	The Duchess. Especially in "Take the Bunny and Run".
Adventures In Wonderland	Black Boss Lady	The Queen of Hearts—African-American, and the only authority figure in Wonderland.
Adventures In Wonderland	Bowdlerize	The Caterpillar lacks his trademark hookah here, possibly out of concerns that it would make kids think Smoking Is Cool.
Adventures In Wonderland	Brilliant, but Lazy	Invoked with the Caterpillar. In the episode "What Makes Rabbit Run", the Queen considers hiring the Caterpillar to be her campaign manager, but decides against it, saying he's "smart, but too slow".
Adventures In Wonderland	Broken Treasure	
Adventures In Wonderland	Bunny-Ears Lawyer	While it only comes up in a few episodes, the Mad Hatter is actually shown to be quite skilled at designing and making hats. Averted when it comes to almost all of his and the Hare's other jobs, though.
Adventures In Wonderland	Butt-Monkey	Rabbit. It's not easy working for the Queen."What about me?! What about my needs?!"
Adventures In Wonderland	Calvinball	Meewalk, a favorite game of the Wonderlanders, has only one rule—the rules can be changed at any time. The Queen takes this up to eleven by changing the rules after the game is over.
Adventures In Wonderland	Canon Foreigner	Crystal, the seemingly sentient computer/TV monitor, is the only Wonderland "character" to have no counterpart from the original stories.
Adventures In Wonderland	Carnivore Confusion	There never appears to be any conflict between the Dormouse and the Cheshire Cat. Then again, they were almost never shown onscreen together; possibly to avoid this.
Adventures In Wonderland	Cats Are Snarkers	The Cheshire Cat, with some instances of the Visual Pun Literalist Snarking he displays in the movie.
Adventures In Wonderland	Character Catchphrase	
Adventures In Wonderland	Characterization Marches On	
Adventures In Wonderland	Chicken Hypnosis Gag	In "Hippity Hoppity Hypnotist," the Queen of Hearts is hypnotized to start clucking and acting like a chicken whenever she hears the word "red"...minutes before she's due to appear on a talk show. And since she's also referred to as the Red Queen...
Adventures In Wonderland	Christmas Episode	Apparently Christmas traditions in Wonderland include hanging fruits and vegetables as decorations, playing the 'Christmas kazoo', and bobbing for Christmas crabapples. And the citizens of Wonderland find the concept of a 'Christmas tree' to be extremely odd (which is understandable, if you think about it). Never mind the fact that it's odd a parallel world like Wonderland would even have a Christmas.
Adventures In Wonderland	Clothespin Nose Plug	In the episode "Arrivederci Aroma'', Alice accidentally spills a whole bottle of perfume onto herself. The Hatter, Hare, and Tweedles put clothespins on their noses when they interact with her.
Adventures In Wonderland	Cloudcuckoolander	Both the Hare and the Hatter. The former usually moreso than the latter, oddly enough.
Adventures In Wonderland	Clown-Car Base	Dormouse's teapot home.
Adventures In Wonderland	Clueless Detective	The Hatter and the Hare act as private eyes in "The Red Queen Crown Affair". They are, predictably, not very good at it and only solve the case by accident.
Adventures In Wonderland	Cold Open	Each episode starts with Alice in her house, talking to Dinah, before walking into the mirror, at which point the Theme starts.
Adventures In Wonderland	Comically Missing the Point	Pretty much everybody does this at some point. It's turned up to eleven in the following exchange:Tweedle Dum: Okay. Hare should be here any minute. Any questions?Mad Hatter: Just one. If the word "knee" is spelled k-n-e-e, why isn't it pronounced "kuh-nee?"Tweedle Dee: Because the "K" is silent. But wait a minute... What does that have to do with the price of rice in—
Adventures In Wonderland	Composite Character	The Queen combines aspects of both the Queen of Hearts from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland—specifically her Hair-Trigger Temper, heart motif, and keeping the White Rabbit as her herald and assistant—and the Red Queen from Through the Looking Glass—namely her Reasonable Authority Figure role, mentorship to Alice, and large ego. Fittingly, the other characters refer to her as both the Queen of Hearts and Red Queen interchangeably.
Adventures In Wonderland	Compressed Vice	This appears a lot on this show. Several episodes have one or more characters abruptly developing a bad character trait—the Hatter can't resist reading the Hare's mail, Tweedle Dum has been eating junk food non-stop, the Hare develops a superiority complex, the Queen suddenly loses all patience for people talking during her speeches, all of the male characters sans the Rabbit & Dormouse start doing nothing but watch television...the list goes on. But after twenty-two minutes, the problem would be solved, and never brought up again.
Adventures In Wonderland	The Conscience	While they all have their moments, the Hare often acts like one to the group whenever they reach a poor choice of judgment.
Adventures In Wonderland	Continuity Nod	
Adventures In Wonderland	Cool and Unusual Punishment	In "That's All, Jokes," after the Queen commands that her subjects and Alice stop their Compressed Vice of playing practical jokes on each other, she punishes them for pranking her personally (booby-trapping a flower so that streamers, balls and rubber chickens fell on her when she picked it) by pieing them all in the face.
Adventures In Wonderland	Costume Evolution	
Adventures In Wonderland	*Crack!* "Oh, My Back!"	In "The Hatter Who Came to Dinner," the Hatter throws out his back with a loud cracking sound when he reaches too far to trim a branch off the Queen's shrub. He ends up having to rest at the palace until his back feels better the next day, and in that time he becomes quite an Annoying Patient to the Queen and the Rabbit.
Adventures In Wonderland	Credits Gag	Mr. Pinniped, the Walrus's invisible friend, is credited As Himself.
Adventures In Wonderland	Dark Is Evil	Three of the one-off villains are dressed head to toe in black.
Adventures In Wonderland	Dastardly Whiplash	The Copy Catter Hatter. Complete with moustache, all-black outfit and shifty behavior.
Adventures In Wonderland	Deadpan Snarker	The Cheshire Cat and Tweedle Dee fit this role most consistently, especially in later episodes. However, pretty much anyone can drop a snarky remark at any time depending on the situation.
Adventures In Wonderland	Demoted to Extra	While she always appears in the intro and outro, many episodes barely feature Alice at all, having her show up for a single scene or musical number while the other characters take center stage.
Adventures In Wonderland	Diminishing Villain Threat	The Queen of Hearts is good-natured, though still a little short tempered (particularly toward the White Rabbit). She seems to be based more on the Red Queen from Through the Looking-Glass (she's even called "the Red Queen" roughly half the time).
Adventures In Wonderland	Distant Duet	The Hatter and his evil cousin do one in "Copy-Catter Hatter". The use of the Split Screen makes it seem like they're aware that it's happening.
Adventures In Wonderland	Divergent Character Evolution	Rather than being Single-Minded Twins like in most versions, the Tweedles developed their own individual traits, with Dee as a cool-headed Deadpan Snarker who was fond of teasing his brother and Dum as the cockier, more impulsive of the two.
Adventures In Wonderland	Does Not Know How to Say "Thanks"	This was the Queen's Compressed Vice in the Thanksgiving episode "Gratitude Adjustment."
Adventures In Wonderland	Does This Remind You of Anything?	
Adventures In Wonderland	Drop-In Character	The Cheshire Cat, with his constant popping up at odd places, plays this to pretty much everyone in Wonderland — but especially to the Queen, who is by far the most likely to suddenly have the Cheshire Cat appear in her home without any kind of prior warning, to insert himself into whatever conversation is going on at the time. Unlike most examples of this trope, though, the Cheshire cat seldom outstays his welcome; he'll show up at the scene, deliver a few punchlines, set up a plot thread or give the other characters an idea, and then vanish again.
Adventures In Wonderland	Eccentric Townsfolk	All the characters except Alice, naturally.
Adventures In Wonderland	Edutainment Show	Downplayed. The show was partially conceived as a way to teach language comprehension, and several episodes do explain things like compound words, adverbs, and mnemonic devices to the viewer. Characters will also define any complex vocabulary words they use and translate terms from other languages. However, these lessons are often not the focus so much as the background for the show's sitcom plots. A good example is "Metaphor Monday": while the episode does explain what metaphors are and gives several examples, the plot mainly focuses on the Tweedles trying to outdo each other before agreeing to work together.
Adventures In Wonderland	Embarrassment Plot	In one episode, Alice splits her pants and everyone else teases her. This makes her so embarrassed and offended that she hides until they apologize.
Adventures In Wonderland	Everyone Has Standards	At one point, the Rabbit has Alice deliver bad news to the Queen instead of delivering it himself, because he knows the Queen wouldn't yell at a little girl.
Adventures In Wonderland	Faint in Shock	The White Rabbit is prone to this in moments of extreme stress, sometimes multiple times in the same episode.
Adventures In Wonderland	Fantastic Racism	The citizens of Wonderland have to learn tolerance when the Walrus moves into their neighborhood, with a bad reputation preceding "his kind".
Adventures In Wonderland	Feud Episode	"Party Pooped" has the Hatter and Hare stop speaking after an argument, while "Metaphor Monday" has the Tweedles' sibling rivalry over a costume contest get out of hand.
Adventures In Wonderland	Friendly Enemies	The Queen and the Duchess. They constantly compete, try to upstage one another, trade insults (the Duchess calls the Queen "Twinkle Toes" for no discernible reason), and mock each other. There's even an entire episode dedicated to their "antagonistic" relationship, with commentary from all of the Wonderlandians about the pair. However, at the end of that episode, the Queen and Duchess sing a duet together that reveals that while they may be bitter rivals, they do like each other deep down, to the point where they swear they'll be frenemies forever.
Adventures In Wonderland	Furry Confusion	The anthropomorphic animal characters portrayed by actors in prosthetic noses and ears live alongside Talking Animals portrayed by puppets, and alongside normal, real animals.
Adventures In Wonderland	Gadgeteer Genius	Both the Hatter and the Hare have shown their fair share of wacky inventions; their most notable being a (supposed) time machine.
Adventures In Wonderland	The Gadfly	The Cheshire Cat, who usually plays Trickster Mentor, but often seems to just be messing with the others because he thinks it's funny.
Adventures In Wonderland	The Ghost	Alice's parents, older sister Kathy, younger brother Brian, best friend Kim, and pen pal Yvette. She talks about them to Dinah, but we never see them. In a few episodes they become The Voice, as we hear them either from offscreen or through Alice's phone. The Duchess is also mentioned but unseen for roughly the first two-thirds of the series, before she finally first appears in "Your Cheatin' Red Heart."
Adventures In Wonderland	Gilligan Cut	
Adventures In Wonderland	God Save Us from the Queen!	A rare aversion (unless she's in one of her moods, but even then the worst she can do is yell or cancel a party). This is probably due to it being Lighter and Softer than the source material.
Adventures In Wonderland	Good Angel, Bad Angel	Tweedle Dum goes through this in "All That Glitters," when trying to decide whether or not to eat a fruit that will make him stronger but might make him sick.
Adventures In Wonderland	Gosh Dang It to Heck!	Alice's annoyed "Oh, marshmallow!" when things don't go her way. The White Rabbit has a similar expression with "Oh, carrot sticks!"
Adventures In Wonderland	Green Aesop	Several. "A Litter Help From My Friends" deals with littering, "Bubble Trouble" with water pollution, and "Weed Shall Overcome" with plant conservation.
Adventures In Wonderland	Hair-Raising Hare	The March Hare bills himself this way for his magic act in "Off the Cuffs."
Adventures In Wonderland	Halloween Episode	Two of them: "Boo Who?" and the series' final episode, "A Wonderland Howl-oween."
Adventures In Wonderland	Hard Truth Aesop	
Adventures In Wonderland	Harmless Freezing	In "Clan of the Cavebunny," the Wonderland gang finds a rabbit frozen in a block of ice in a cave, and once his ears are unfrozen, their movement reveals that he's alive.  In the end, it turns out he's not the prehistoric "cavebunny" they assumed he was, but the White Rabbit's Uncle Hasenpfeffer, who's been missing for a year. Lampshaded when Alice objects that nothing frozen in a block of ice can still be alive, but the Hare reminds her that this is Wonderland.
Adventures In Wonderland	Herr Doktor	The Hatter's disguise as Professor Memory in "Forget Me Knot".
Adventures In Wonderland	Hiccup Hijinks	The episode "Hic-Hic-Hooray" has Tweedle Dum get the hiccups on the very day he's supposed to carry boxes of the Queen's fragile new china dishware.
Adventures In Wonderland	Hidden Depths	Although she often acts immaturely, the Queen is occasionally shown to be quite intelligent and cunning and can even be a sort of Cool Big Sis to Alice. See, for example, "Odd Woman Out", where the Queen helps Alice get back at the men of Wonderland for forming a boys-only club. "Christmas In Wonderland" also gives us a rare look at her more wistful side.
Adventures In Wonderland	Hilarious Outtakes	A blooper reel does exist, but it was only made for a cast party and wasn't initially released to the public due to its mature tone.
Adventures In Wonderland	His Name Really Is "Barkeep"	In this series, the March Hare's name really is March Hare. Everyone in his family is named after a month.
Adventures In Wonderland	Hyperspace Arsenal	The Hare almost always has whatever prop is called for at the time stored in his jacket. Almost.
Adventures In Wonderland	Hypno Fool	The episode "Hippity Hoppity Hypnotist" has the Hare try and fail to hypnotize the Rabbit, but accidentally hypnotize the Queen instead. She ends up making a fool of herself on a live TV cooking show by imitating a chicken every time she hears the word "red."
Adventures In Wonderland	Hypnotic Trigger	In "Hippity Hoppity Hypnotist," the March Hare inadvertently hypnotizes the Queen of Hearts into acting like a chicken whenever she hears the word "red." Two problems immediately ensue—one is that her other common title is the Red Queen, and the second is that she's about to appear on a televised cooking show.
Adventures In Wonderland	Ignored Aesop	Unlike Alice or the White Rabbit, the Hare and the Red Queen tend to misinterpret or reject the morals of the Caterpillar's stories. True for the the Duchess as well in "The Royalty Trap".
Adventures In Wonderland	Incredibly Long Note	One episode had The Hatter go on a Star Search like show and try and compete against the undefeated champion, a man who was capable of delivering an exaggerated version of this (as in the long note is the only "lyric" of the song). He loses.
Adventures In Wonderland	In Medias Res	Alice has already been visiting Wonderland before the first episode.
Adventures In Wonderland	Insane Troll Logic	When asked which came first, the chicken or the egg, the Hare concludes that since eggs are for breakfast and breakfast comes first, then the egg came first.
Adventures In Wonderland	Insidious Rumor Mill	In "The Wonderland Enquirer", the Queen is bored with the dull stories in the newspaper, "The Wonderland Bee", and orders the editors, Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee, to print every juicy rumor they hear, whether the stories can be proved or not. She realizes her mistake when she becomes a victim of the rumor mill.
Adventures In Wonderland	Instant Home Delivery	In "Arrivederci Aroma'', the Mad Hatter drops an order for spray paint into the Wonderland Mailbox. A few moments later, the lights on the mailbox flash, telling him his order has arrived, and he reaches in and takes out his package.Mad Hatter: [waiting for the lights to flash] Huh. Mail delivery is so slow these days.Cheshire Cat: Well, don't be mad.Mad Hatter: Oh, I always have to be mad. Yeah, my mother said so.
Adventures In Wonderland	I Owe You My Life	In the episode "From Hare to Eternity," the Hare appoints himself the Queen's new bodyguard after she saves him from quicksand and drives her crazy with his overzealous attempts to "protect" her.
Adventures In Wonderland	It's All About Me	The Queen has a tendency to slip into this sort of thinking. Unlike most incarnations, this version of the Queen is not a tyrant, and in fact quite often appears as a downright Reasonable Authority Figure — but she has a tendency to put herself and her own wants above everyone else's needs.
Adventures In Wonderland	Jerk with a Heart of Gold	
Adventures In Wonderland	Karma Houdini	
Adventures In Wonderland	Lame Pun Reaction	Lampshaded in "Copy Catter Hatter" when Tweedle Dee gets annoyed at the Caterpillar for making bad puns about pickles instead of helping the Hatter.
Adventures In Wonderland	Landline Eavesdropping	In "Lip-Sunk", Alice’s off-screen brother Brian spies on her phone conversation with her friend through the landline, annoying her and prompting her trip through the looking-glass.
Adventures In Wonderland	Large Ham	Applies to the Mad Hatter, the Red Queen, and especially the Caterpillar.
Adventures In Wonderland	Laser-Guided Karma	When Tweedle Dum gets trapped in a pair of magic handcuffs, Tweedle Dee sings a song that is both making fun of his brother and bragging that such a thing would never happen to him. Right when the song ends, Alice puts the cuffs on Dee too.
Adventures In Wonderland	Last-Name Basis	Or a variant thereof, as the characters are usually referred to by the last part of their full names. So, for the most part, you hear them call each other Queen, Rabbit, Hatter, Hare and so on.
Adventures In Wonderland	Later-Installment Weirdness	The later episodes tend to bring more "normal" elements from the real world into Wonderland. For example, real, non-sapient animals who are kept as pets in "Day of the Iguana" and "Queen's Best Friend," and a realistic hospital in "Take My Tonsils, Please!" and optometrist's office in "Those Tusks, Those Eyes!" Some episodes also featured real-world celebrities as themselves, like Ed McMahon in "Hats Off to the King" or O. J. Simpson in the Lost Episode "White Rabbits Can't Jump", when in earlier episodes Wonderland had its own local celebrities, like Rabbit De Niro or mouse actress Meryl Squeak.
Adventures In Wonderland	Lethal Chef	
Adventures In Wonderland	Lightbulb Joke	How many Queens does it take to change a light bulb?Tweedle Dee: None!White Rabbit: She makes me do it.
Adventures In Wonderland	Lighter and Softer	For starters, as mentioned above, pretty much every character in Wonderland is much more reasonable, friendlier, and affable than their literary and movie counterparts. Also, at any rate, you won't be seeing the Queen order the beheading of any of the characters. Justified, as this show is intended for a young audience.
Adventures In Wonderland	Literal-Minded	Mainly the Hare's thing, but just about all of the Wonderland inhabitants were prone to this on occasion.
Adventures In Wonderland	Lost Episode	"White Rabbits Can't Jump," featuring special guest star... O. J. Simpson. Really. The only remaining trace of this episode is the children's book adaptation by M. C. Varley and Lynn Houston, which Disney published in 1993.
Adventures In Wonderland	Lost Him in a Card Game	The plot of "Take the Bunny and Run". The Queen loses the Rabbit to the Duchess in a card game but ultimately manages to win him back.
Adventures In Wonderland	Lost Voice Plot	In "Lip-Sunk," the Queen loses her voice just before she's supposed to give a speech. The other Wonderland characters try to find her missing voice, but in the end Alice cures her with lemon-and-honey tea.
Adventures In Wonderland	Lovable Nerd	The March Hare. He's very dorky, wears Nerd Glasses and tacky clothes and is pretty intelligent, though short on common sense, and is also a very likable guy.
Adventures In Wonderland	Magic Feather	In "Through the Looking Glasses," the Cheshire Cat gives the White Rabbit a pair of rose-colored glasses, tricking him into thinking they're magic and can make everything look more beautiful. The glasses truly seem to work for everyone, but in the end it turns out they're not magic at all – the belief that they were just made everyone look at things in a different way and notice the beauty that was always there.
Adventures In Wonderland	Mandatory Line	Two pretty egregious ones, with the Caterpiller and the Cheshire Cat. The Chesire Cat, in at least one episode, literally gets two lines and then disappears, never to be mentioned. The Caterpiller, meanwhile, goes between this and Big-Lipped Alligator Moment, where someone comes across him, hears a story, and he's never mentioned again.
Adventures In Wonderland	Meaningful Name	The Walrus's invisible best friend is named Mr. Pinniped. "Pinniped" is the Latin for "fin-footed," a term used to describe mammals with fin-like feet—such as walruses.
Adventures In Wonderland	Minimalist Cast	There are only ten characters in the main cast, not counting the occasional guest star.
Adventures In Wonderland	Missed Him by That Much	In "Double Your Bunny", the White Rabbit and his cousin Redford keep missing each other.Alice: How did he change clothes so fast?[The Caterpillar shrugs with 6 of his hands.]
Adventures In Wonderland	The Moving Experience	In the episode "Welcome Back Hatter," the Hatter wins a "castle" in a contest and everyone thinks he'll be moving away from Wonderland to live in it, but in the end it turns out that the castle is a tiny toy.
Adventures In Wonderland	Multi-Armed Multitasking	The Caterpillar, who has six hands, is often seen doing various things with all of them at once.
Adventures In Wonderland	Musical World Hypothesis	Falls under the Alternate Universe type. It makes sense, considering that in the source material, both Alice and the characters she met frequently broke into rhymes and songs.
Adventures In Wonderland	Mythology Gag	
Adventures In Wonderland	Nearly Normal Animal	Dinah... possibly. While she never does anything a normal cat wouldn't, several episodes have her react to Alice in ways that wouldn't make sense if she didn't understand everything the girl said to her and was capable of human-like thought.
Adventures In Wonderland	Nerd Glasses	This incarnation of the March Hare sports them.
Adventures In Wonderland	New Super Power	Played straight and parodied in "The Adventures of Spectacular Man," in which the Hatter wishes that he could be a comic book superhero. Next thing we know, he has turned into a combination of Superman and The Lone Ranger.The Tweedles: Who was that masked man?
Adventures In Wonderland	Nice Guy	The Walrus, which is certainly a change from how the character has traditionally been presented. He's polite, genial, friendly and accepting — he also seems incapable of bearing a grudge towards anyone. Quite a change from the Faux Affably Evil scoundrel from the original poem and movie.
Adventures In Wonderland	No Celebrities Were Harmed	
Adventures In Wonderland	No Matter How Much I Beg	The Hatter evokes this trope word for word in "He's Not Heavy, He's My Hatter," when he makes the Hare promise not to let him eat any more cookies so he can lose weight.
Adventures In Wonderland	Not So Above It All	While she's usually the Only Sane Girl, Alice can be just as silly as the Wonderlandians, especially in episodes where the group is caught up in some activity. Examples include telling jokes in "Mirth of a Nation", throwing cream pies in "Pie Noon", and mocking the White Rabbit in "To Tear is Human."
Adventures In Wonderland	Offscreen Teleportation	The Dormouse can somehow relocate himself to another teapot (and a flowerpot in one occasion) by utilizing this. It's never explained, though then again, this is Wonderland.
Adventures In Wonderland	One-Man Band	The Caterpillar is sometimes seen playing multiple instruments at once, thanks to his extra pairs of arms.
Adventures In Wonderland	One-Note Cook	The Queen is normally a Lethal Chef, but in "Pizza de Resistance," when the Rabbit is making his pizza for her royal pizza contest, she "helps" him so much that she ends up making the pizza herself, and it turns out so well that she decides to always cook her own pizza from then on.
Adventures In Wonderland	The Oner	The Hatter and Hare's song in "Wonderland: The Movie" is performed in one continuous take.
Adventures In Wonderland	Paper-Thin Disguise	A favorite trope on this show. It's particularly ludicrous because there are exactly six humans (or humanoids) living in Wonderland, and everyone always knows when someone new comes to town—yet the disguises are often foolproof (which says something about the nature of the place).
Adventures In Wonderland	Parental Bonus	Lots of literary allusion titles ("From Hare to Eternity," "What Makes Rabbit Run," "The Bunny Who Would Be King," "The Grape Juice of Wrath") and film/TV allusion titles ("Pie Noon," "Card 54, Where Are You?").
Adventures In Wonderland	The Performer King	The Red Queen has been known to perform for her subjects.
Adventures In Wonderland	Pet the Dog	The Queen might be a bit of a Royal Brat, but whenever the show deals with serious social issues like bigotry or ableism, she's usually the one who helps teach the Aesop, not learn it:
Adventures In Wonderland	Pie in the Face	Turns up in several episodes:
Adventures In Wonderland	Plot Allergy	In the episode "Something to Sneeze At," the Hatter starts sneezing whenever he's near the Hare, and they think they can never share a tea party again. In the end, they realize the Hatter's allergic to the flowers the Hare has been wearing in his lapel.
Adventures In Wonderland	The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything	Subverted, actually. Even including the original novel, this is one of the very few versions of Lewis Carroll's story in which the Mad Hatter is seen actually designing and making hats.
Adventures In Wonderland	Tongue Twister	In the episode "Untwist of Fate", Alice gets caught in a twister. It turns out that it was a "tongue twister", so every time she tries to speak, she says a random tongue twister.
Adventures In Wonderland	The Tonsillitis Episode	"Take My Tonsils... Please!" is this for the Hatter.
Adventures In Wonderland	Took a Level in Kindness	Just about all the Wonderlandians, compared to the Disney animated movie and even the book versions of them. The Cheshire Cat is an interesting example, because he famously Took a Level in Jerkass for the Disney movie, but here he's gone back to approximately the same level of kindness he displayed in the original book.
Against The Wall	Happily Adopted	Donnie by the end of the episode in which the adoption is revealed, it seems.
Adventures In Wonderland	Prank Gone Too Far	In the episode "Invasion of the Tweedle Snatchers", Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee have bought a remote-control flying saucer, intending to ask the Hatter if he'd like to give it to his nephew, Beanie Hatter, as a birthday present. Since the Hatter, the Hare, and the Dormouse have all gone jogging, the Cheshire Cat offers to keep an eye on the gift. As soon as the Tweedles are gone, he makes himself and the remote control invisible, leaving the flying saucer itself visible. When the Hatter, the Hare, and the Dormouse return, the cat invisibly talks to them, pretending to be an alien. As a result, the other three think Wonderland has been invaded by tiny green aliens in a miniature flying saucer. On top of that, the Hatter and the Hare overhear the Tweedles talking about how they think they can convince the Hatter of how great their flying saucer is, and Dee adds, "Pretty soon he'll be just like us! He'll wish he could spend all his time flying the flying saucer." As a result, the Hatter and the Hare think that the aliens have taken over the minds of the Tweedles and that they want to get control of the Hatter's next.
Adventures In Wonderland	Race Lift	The Queen, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum are played by African Americans.
Adventures In Wonderland	Real After All	An odd example. The Walrus's best friend Mr. Pinniped is invisible. In their debut episode, this is treated by the characters as a lie (because walruses are notorious for making up stories), but Mr. Pinniped is very much real. It's confirmed in an episode where  someone is tagging Wonderland with graffiti—the culprit turns out to be Mr. Pinniped, who was trying to get more attention from the group.
Adventures In Wonderland	Reasonable Authority Figure	The Queen of Hearts. Though she occasionally passes silly rules, she's generally a kind monarch who cares about her subjects and is willing to help them with their problems.
Adventures In Wonderland	Rhymes on a Dime	In one episode, the White Rabbit catches "rhymitis", which has this effect on his speech, only for it to spread to other characters. One of the songs in this episode, "It Doesn't Rhyme", actually subverts this, with the Rabbit deliberately avoiding rhymes at the end of each line.
Adventures In Wonderland	Running Gag	
Adventures In Wonderland	Series Continuity Error	
Adventures In Wonderland	Setting Update	Alice obviously isn't living in the 1800s during the segments where she's in the real world. She's also not from England.
Adventures In Wonderland	"Shaggy Dog" Story	Several episodes have the characters attempting to complete some task, only to end up exactly where they started.
Adventures In Wonderland	Shout-Out	
Adventures In Wonderland	Sitcom Arch-Nemesis	The Duchess is this to the Queen, especially once we finally see them together onscreen. They are ostensibly friends but they're fooling nobody.
Adventures In Wonderland	Slice of Life	Albeit very quirky life.
Adventures In Wonderland	Snake Oil Salesman	Stuart Pankin's character, Scallywag Jones, is a sleazy con artist who tricks the Rabbit into buying a fake money tree seed with the Queen's cash.
Adventures In Wonderland	Spinning Clock Hands	Parodied in "The Adventures of Spectacular Man," when the Hatter and Hare spend the night reading comic books - the Hare comments "You really should fix that clock," and the Hatter pounds it to make the hands stop spinning.
Adventures In Wonderland	Stage Magician	The Hare becomes one in "Off the Cuffs", called the Amazing Hair-Raising Hare.
Adventures In Wonderland	Start My Own	One episode sees the Hatter upset that the Hare is always late to their tea parties, so the Hare decides he's going to throw his own at precisely the same time. The rest of the Wonderlandians don't want to make either feel bad, so they go to both and end up too full to enjoy themselves.
Adventures In Wonderland	The Storyteller	The Caterpillar tells a short story Once per Episode, which is animated with Clay Mation and has An Aesop which relates to the moral of the rest of the episode.
Adventures In Wonderland	Stock Animal Diet	The White Rabbit loves carrots and leafy green vegetables, the Cheshire Cat loves cream, and the Dormouse loves cheese.
Adventures In Wonderland	Strictly Formula	The plots are all built around An Aesop (the basic formula is in the article description), but the characters themselves arguably keep the show entertaining. It helps that, aside from the Caterpillar, Dormouse, and the Cheshire Cat, every character take turns learning the episode's aesop. This trope also applies to the framing scenes in Alice's room: Alice talks to her cat Dinah about some typical childhood problem or dilemma she's having, then steps through her mirror into Wonderland, where the main plot somehow parallels her situation, and when she comes home, she tells Dinah the Aesop she's learned which will solve her problem.
Adventures In Wonderland	Stylistic Suck	The caterpillar's storybooks intentionally have very rudimentary stop-motion animation to make it look like illustrations in a storybook.
Adventures In Wonderland	Subverted Rhyme Every Occasion	The song the White Rabbit sings after he's cured of his "rhymitis" is built entirely out of these — he's happy to finally be able to not rhyme.
Adventures In Wonderland	Superhero Episode	"The Adventures of Spectacular Man", in which a shooting star gives the Hatter superpowers and turns him into the masked hero, Spectacular Man.
Adventures In Wonderland	Suspiciously Specific Denial	In "The Wonderland Enquirer," Alice does this while tying to avoid eating the crumpets at the Hatter's tea party, after reading the rumor in the newspaper that they're stale:Alice: I'm not saying they're not fresh... or that they're hard... or stale... or so tough that they would hurt my teeth.
Adventures In Wonderland	The Summation	The Hatter does this at the end of "The Red Queen Crown Affair." Given that it's the Hatter,  and the missing crown is under his hat, this goes about as well as could be expected.Hatter: What I have to say will shock you. It will startle you. It will remind you of a hundred old movies.
Adventures In Wonderland	Temporal Theme Naming	The Hare family has a month-theme going on, with Mother June, Cousin April, Aunt May, Uncle August, Sister May, and of course the March Hare himself.
Adventures In Wonderland	Tempting Fate	In "Off the Cuffs," Tweedle Dee has a whole number where he ridicules his brother for getting handcuffed to the ever-growing chain of characters. Guess what happens to Dee the moment his song ends?
Adventures In Wonderland	That Reminds Me of a Song	There doesn't usually have to be much of an excuse for them to break into song, often without warning.
Adventures In Wonderland	Toccata and Fugue in D minor	"A Wonderland Howl-oween" features a spoof of the classic horror movie The Phantom of the Opera. One night, the Queen and the White Rabbit explore a catacomb to find out where strange, spooky, unearthly noises are coming from. They find a masked figure (the Hatter) playing this piece on an Ominous Pipe Organ.
Adventures In Wonderland	Too Many Cooks Spoil the Soup	In "Her-story in the Making", Alice tries getting her Wonderland friends to write a story for her school assignment for her. They each write a passage and it comes out... less than comprehensible.
Adventures In Wonderland	Trademark Favorite Food	
Adventures In Wonderland	Trickster Mentor	The Cheshire Cat, on occasion, takes on this role.
Adventures In Wonderland	Trrrilling Rrrs	Three characters will occasionally use these.
Adventures In Wonderland	Two Girls to a Team	Alice and the Queen are the only female main characters.
Adventures In Wonderland	Uncanny Family Resemblance	The Mad Hatter and his evil second cousin twice-removed, the Copy Catter Hatter. Just about any of the character's relatives count, actually. (See Acting for Two in the Trivia section.)
Adventures In Wonderland	Unfazed Everygirl	Alice, in a way that's slightly different than what we're used to from other incarnations of her. This Alice, while still very much the Only Sane Woman, is right at home in Wonderland and hardly ever plays the Fish out of Water or even reacts to any of the silliness in any big way.
Adventures In Wonderland	Very Special Episode	
Adventures In Wonderland	Villain Song	
Adventures In Wonderland	Visual Pun	"Metaphor Monday" features a costume ball where all the Wonderland residents dress up as their favorite metaphors, resulting in this.
Adventures In Wonderland	A Weighty Aesop	
Adventures In Wonderland	What's Up, King Dude?	Alice and the Wonderlanders pretty much come and go as they please at the Queen's palace.
Adventures In Wonderland	Whole-Plot Reference	
Adventures In Wonderland	Who's on First?	
Adventures In Wonderland	Wily Walrus	Subverted. Walruses are apparently viewed as wicked, malicious creatures - most likely because of the walrus from "The Walrus and the Carpenter" - and thus everyone is appalled when Alice befriends a nice, polite walrus. Whether that walrus was an outlier in Wonderland is unrevealed.
Adventures In Wonderland	With Friends Like These...	The Queen and the Duchess, big time. They fight so much one wonders if they can even be called friends.
Adventures In Wonderland	World of Pun	As you'd expect given the source material, Wonderland runs on wordplay. Characters constantly have Fun with Homophones and several episodes teach linguistic concepts, such as contractions, prefixes, compound words, and metaphors. Occasionally Lampshaded when characters call out each other for making a pun.
Adventures In Wonderland	Wouldn't Hurt a Child	The Queen, which really underlines how much of an Adaptational Nice Girl she is. In both book and movie, the Queen of Hearts thought nothing of ordering a child's execution — here (despite her Royal Brat and It's All About Me tendencies), she's not only a far more benevolent ruler, but she's especially gentle with Alice, never even raising her voice to the girl.
Adventures In Wonderland	Year Inside, Hour Outside	While the show never came down firmly on the question of how Wonderland and "real world" time differ, a few episodes drop clues that Alice returns to her bedroom mere seconds after her trips regardless of their length. "TV or Not TV?" is explicitly stated to take place over a period of three days, but when Alice comes back to sum up what she's learned to Dinah, she talks about the homework she has to do that night (the same homework that she was complaining about when the show started), so it's been a period of minutes at most. Similarly, "Christmas in Wonderland" happens over the course of at least eight hours (it's bright and sunny when Alice arrives, and nightfall at the end of the Wonderland segment), but again, she returns to the real world without any time elapsing.
Adventures In Wonderland	Yet Another Christmas Carol	This time with a healthy eating theme! Tweedle Dum, who is apparently the "King of Junk Food," is visited by a Jacob Marley-esque Hare and the Ghosts of Nutrition Past (the Hatter), Present (the Queen), and Future (the White Rabbit) to learn about the consequences of his diet.
Adventures In Wonderland	You Mean "Xmas"	Averted with Valentine's Day, Halloween and Christmas, which are all celebrated in Wonderland, albeit in unusual ways, but played straight with the Thanksgiving-esque "Thanks-A-Lot Day."
Adventures In Wonderland	Your Television Hates You	At the beginning of one episode, the Queen sits at her table waiting for the White Rabbit to return with a pizza she's ordered. She tries to take her mind off her hunger by watching some TV; it happens to be showing a pizza commercial, which doesn't help her problem at all (though the Rabbit quickly arrives).
Agent X	Action Prologue	The show starts when John Case was held prisoner by VEVAK in a prison in Tehran. He gets saved later by a masked Raymond Marks.
Agent X	America Saves the Day	What the section does by the end of each episode whenever they resolve a situation.
Agent X	Artistic License – History	The premise of the show relies on there existing a secret version of the constitution with an extra section. The Constitution in its original incarnation was adopted by all the states separately, meaning they couldn't keep a separate "real" version. Beyond that, such a secret clause could never be legal, as it's secrecy cannot be achieved without also excluding it from any and all of the various bodies that would legitimize it. (No, showing the Chief Justice your cool secret old piece of paper doesn't count.)
Agent X	As You Know	Maccabee's backstory is revealed in a series of news clips. Justified Trope as she's a newly elected high-ranking government official whose backstory would've already been brought out during the campaign.
Agent X	Blatant Lies	In "Enemy of My Enemy", visitors in a missile auction were told not to panic when they heard sounds of explosions and small arms fire. They still flee.
Agent X	Cloud Cuckoo Lander	The biochemist, Harold Hellman, in "Truth, Lies and Consequences".
Agent X	Diplomatic Impunity	Volker's associates in "Pilot" held Missy Stanton in the construction site for a new Russian Embassy in Washington D.C. The problem was that it had immunity from Moscow. Averted since S5 went into the building to save the victim.
Agent X	Elite Agents Above the Law	Agent X is answerable only to the Vice President, as designated by a secret section of the Constitution.
Agent X	Elites Are More Glamorous	The Russian Army Spetsnaz show up in news broadcasts in "The Enemy of My Enemy" as being responsible for breaking up a terrorist meeting in Chechnya when S5 did it entirely with help from Olga.
Agent X	Enemy Mine	Near the end of "The Enemy of My Enemy", Case teams up with a radical Chechen warlord because his group turned against him, courtesy of Nicholas Volker. He also works with Olga on the case.
Agent X	Expy	Section Five to Third Echelon, only except that the former operates under the Office of the Vice President.
Agent X	Government Conspiracy	The season 1 plot arc appears to involve this; the VP and her agent stumble across a group of people forming a "shadow government" in violation of the Constitution. This also involved using KGB-era nuke suitcases.
Agent X	Hollywood Law	When the President is incapacitated, the VP takes over his duties, per the 25th Amendment. That much is accurate. However, the Speaker of the House, despite being next in line of succession, does not automatically take over the duties of the VP. In fact, it's against the law for any public official to serve in two branches of government (executive and legislative in this case) at the same time. When the VP temporarily takes over for the President, they don't stop being the VP, they simply assume the presidential duties. If the VP position needs to be permanently filled outside an election, someone has to be nominated and ratified by the Senate like any other executive branch appointee.
Agent X	I Have Your Wife	A recurring subplot in the show.
Agent X	Locked Out of the Loop	By law, no one is allowed to know of the actions of Section Five, including the President himself. In the pilot, Natalie goes to President Eckhart, who, having previously been VP himself, would know of the Section and seeks his advice. While not openly mentioning what they're talking about, Eckhart makes it clear to Natalie that she is never to discuss anything of Section Five with him again and that he not only doesn't want to know what she does but can't know in order to make the whole thing work.
Agent X	Make It Look Like an Accident	The usual MO used by S5 in case they need to take out hostiles or make dead civilians look like they died in an accident if the case they're on is too risky for law enforcement to get involved.Case: What are you going to do with Williams' [body]?Malcolm: Awful car wreck.
Agent X	Masquerade	The entire existence of Section Five. No one, except previous vice presidents and their associates, is privy to the knowledge. If anyone is captured or killed, S5 will do anything they can to deny their existence. If their actions are reported in the media, the local police/military are always credited.
Agent X	Newscaster Cameo	Wolf Blitzer shows up in "Pilot" when he reports on Vice President Maccabbee being sworn in as the first female to be elected in history.
Agent X	New Rules as the Plot Demands	When Maccabee is presumed missing and/or dead and Section 5 has an urgent situation arise, Eckhart resumes temporary control under a hitherto-never-before-referred-to "Protocol 9".
Agent X	Oh, Crap!	Case was able to evacuate Missy from the grounds of the future Russian embassy when he runs into one of Markov's men.
Agent X	Only in It for the Money	The reason why Dr. Eugene Bullock agreed to rearm the hijacked missiles for Volker.
Agent X	Plausible Deniability	The entire point of the Section. By keeping it secret even from the President, the U.S. can't claim involvement if a mission goes wrong. Indeed, President Eckhart makes it clear right off to Natalie that he is never to be let in on what she does with the operations just as he had to do the same as VP himself.
Agent X	Police Are Useless	Played with. Any investigation of S5's actions is going to be suppressed by the group in order to prevent their existence from being revealed.
Agent X	The Reveal	John Case finally runs down Nicholas Volker. It's his predecessor as Agent X, Raymond Marks. Eckhart ordered Malcolm to assassinate him when he started going rogue.
Agent X	Rousing Speech	In "Truth, Lies and Consequences", President Eckhart gives such a speech, which also serves as a warning shot across the bow of the cabal working against him.
Agent X	Shadow Government	Vice President Maccabbee picks up on evidence that some members of the American government, including those from the CIA, are building up a shadow government as part of their plans to overthrow President Eckhart with the help of Volker.
Agent X	Spanner in the Works	FBI Director Stanton's sermon on Missy when she initially refused to reveal Case's existence (before she agreed to identify him via photos) is one to keeping his S5 work from going public.
Agent X	Spiritual Successor	One for the Splinter Cell franchise. Both have black ops units working under direct orders to protect America and its nationals against foreign and domestic enemies by any means possible, even if it includes violating human rights to do so.
Agent X	Wham Episode	
Agent X	Wham Line	alik: You're gonna re-arm the missiles? Yeah?Bullock: Yes. But not for you.
Agent X	Wham Shot	The Mole in the Secret Service makes a second assassination attempt on Eckhart, injecting poison into his IV. The guards outside the door hear a crash and come running in. They find Eckhart strangling his would-be assassin with the IV line, simultaneously preventing the poison from reaching his arm. President Action indeed.
Agent X	What Happened to the Mouse?	Two important objects, the Geryon and the authentic Constitution with S5 in it, are gone and not shown to be in anyone's possession as of the end of Season 1. The planned Season 2 would have touched on this.
Agent X	Who Shot JFK?	Season 1 suggests that JFK was killed in Dallas because of his plans to go up against a conspiracy that was forming in Washington.
Agent X	Working the Same Case	Both the FBI and S5 were working on saving Missy from her abductors in "Pilot".
Agent X	Would Hit a Girl	Markov's men didn't have a problem killing Missy when Olga told them to get rid of her in "Pilot".

A History Of Scotland	Wham Line	"It's mid-winter, 1230. A horrific scene is played out in the middle of a busy market square: An infant child is held up to the crowds. Seconds later, she's dead. Her small corpse lies discarded in the mud, her brains splattered across the column of the market cross."
A History Of Scotland	What Happened to the Mouse?	Real Life example with the Picts, who simply vanished from the records with very little trace when the Kingdom of Scotland first appeared in them.
A History Of Scotland	Wild Wilderness	The Scottish Highlands: "Britain's last great wilderness; a place as beautiful as it is barren".
A History Of Scotland	Young Conqueror	Alexander II. After his English allies turned on him he abandoned the north of England and he embarked on a campaign to bring the largely independent Scottish Highland's under his control.
After Midnight	Accentuate the Negative	The point of recurring game Kill The Vibe — we watch an incredibly cute, heartwarming internet video, and panelists buzz in with mean-spirited, bitter comments. One video has four Chinese tiger cubs being cared for by a Labrador dog. It's adorable... until:Guy Branum: Wanna know what else was raised by a Chinese lab? Covid-19. Paul F. Tompkins: Typical white bitch, adopting Asian babies for clout.
After Midnight	Actually Pretty Funny	
After Midnight	The Announcer	When season 2 premiered, it brought with it Laura Peek, who took over for Taylor in introducing the contestants.
After Midnight	Anti-Climax	On February 26, 2024, they played a game with the unabashedly long title How Long Until They Put A Full Slice Of American Cheese In It, where the object is to guess just that for a TikTok recipe video. Panelists have to wager their points on their guess, so Marc Maron makes a big show of how hard a struggle it is to decide, before he finally settles on 11 seconds (while Zainab Johnson picks 3, and Brendan Hunt picks 1). The video plays, and the cheese lands on the prepared food at 12 seconds, giving Marc the points by a landslide. And how many points did he wager for this epic victory?Marc: ...four. Taylor: [incredulous] Four points?? Marc: Yeah. [Marc gets four points as Brendan starts snickering, while Zainab and Taylor are dying laughing]
After Midnight	Anti-Humor	Frequently used by Reggie Watts whenever he shows up, like the Cloud Cuckoolander he is. Also, Zach Cherry appeared once and invoked this a couple times, just to nerd out about science instead of giving any proper answer. Even Pete Holmes was bewildered by Zach.
After Midnight	Attention Deficit... Ooh, Shiny!	Introducing a game where contestants have to pay attention to details in a short video, Taylor invokes this:Taylor: If there's one thing we can all agree on, it's... wait, what was I saying? ...oh yeah, attention spans! [audience groan-laughs] You thought I [bleep]ed up, but it was in the prompter!
After Midnight	Audience Participation	Much like the original, viewers are encouraged to post their own responses for the Hashtag Wars, with the producers' favorite shown on the next episode.
After Midnight	Badass Boast	aylor: Megan Gailey. In a word, give us your five-year plan. Megan Gailey: [dramatically turns to face the camera] EGOT.
After Midnight	Big "NO!"	One round of Hashtag Wars has Caitlin Reilly getting perpetually beaten to the buzzer by Gillian Jacobs and Pete Holmes, and she slowly goes nuts until the round ends, with Caitlin only getting in a measly two responses. The ending buzzer causes her to scream "NOOOOOOOOOO!!!" at the top of her lungs... and then reach over to Taylor's podium to give herself more points... only for them to go to Pete instead.
After Midnight	Bitch in Sheep's Clothing	Caitlin Reilly adopts this persona whenever she appears. Very nice and complementary to Taylor, then proceeding to be a Competition Freak and Drama Queen.
After Midnight	Biting-the-Hand Humor	
After Midnight	Black Comedy	The second episode has a game about figuring out what movie a dodgy review is about, and the first one just says "this happened to my buddy Eric".Sophie Buddle: The Passion of the Christ.Paul F. Tompkins: Blackfish.Carl Tart: May December.
After Midnight	Black Comedy Burst	
After Midnight	Blunt "No"	Esther Povitsky competed while 8 months pregnant, so Taylor brings this up in the Talk Show Portion:Taylor: Esther, you are 8 months pregnant. [audience cheers] I know! And therefore a hero! Do you like being pregnant? Esther: Ummm... no. Let's just say that if anyone in this room could perform an illegal c-section, I would let them.
After Midnight	Break the Haughty	Catherine Cohen comes into her episode very cocky (playfully of course), at one point buzzing in and calling on herself before Taylor can. She carries this energy right up until she's eliminated, which prompts a Jaw Drop from her. And just to rub it in, she's swiftly whisked off stage by a Vaudeville Hook.
After Midnight	Breaking News Interruption	invoked The September 30, 2024 episode contains one of these...which turns out to just be a setup to a game claiming Moo Deng (a baby pygmy hippo) was arrested for biting its zookeeper.
After Midnight	Brick Joke	Nish Kumar gets eliminated in one episode and is tasked to tell the audience something he's never told anyone. So Nish replies, cryptically, that he's stolen three computers from the Paramount lot. When he comes back on stage to congratulate the winner at the end credits, somehow he's holding three laptops.
After Midnight	Butt-Monkey	
After Midnight	Cast Full of Gay	This show leans into queer comedians noticeably more than its predecessor did. It's not uncommon for entire panels to be out and proud, and lest we forget, Taylor is proudly bisexual herself.
After Midnight	Celebrity Impersonator	
After Midnight	Chekhov's Gag	Bit of a subtle one — on February 5, 2024, Taylor asked Bianca Del Rio "what you would change about me" and Bianca, being Bianca, misdirected for a good while before a very curt "change your hair." The very next night, viewers noticed that Taylor did, in fact, wear her hair down for the first time in a while. (After all, when a Drag Queen gives you fashion advice, you take it.)
After Midnight	Cloud Cuckoolander	
After Midnight	Comically Missing the Point	During the Talk Show Portion on February 7, 2024:Taylor: London, what's your favorite flavor? London Hughes: I would have to say... Flav. [London is awarded points by Taylor] Taylor: [laughing] I'm not even supposed to give points on this, but I did!
After Midnight	Freeze-Frame Bonus	The prize for September 23, 2024 is a to-do list from "someone very important". Pausing and reading it before we get to Taylor's jokes reveals that it's just chock full of jokes about Zendaya.
After Midnight	From Bad to Worse	It isn't bad enough that Fortune Feimster gets eliminated and has to give the usual losing speech; no, Taylor then finds a baby picture of her in a bonnet and puts it on the screen for all to see.
Aikatsu Planet	Maybe Magic, Maybe Mundane	The mechanics behind the Aikatsu Planet! world aren't really explained.
After Midnight	Competition Freak	It's a fake game show, as Taylor loves to remind us, but occasionally a panelist proves to be a bit competitive and leans toward Serious Business. Catherine Cohen and Caitlin Reilly (the latter of whom went so far as to suck up to Taylor and call her "mommy") are notable examples, and Marcella Arguello was this on her first appearance (until Large Ham Marcella decided it was more fun to do an elimination). Matt Rogers was a particularly humorous example.Taylor: [after Hashtag Wars] My favorite part of that whole thing was when Matt- when James buzzed in and Matt was just like "NO!!!!!" Matt Rogers: I'm competitive!! Taylor: [laughing] That was so raw and real and genuine!
After Midnight	Coordinated Clothes	On the June 6, 2024 edition, Kelsey Cook, Brian Simpson and Blair Socci all wore suits identical to Taylor's just for a gag. Taylor, of course, is delighted.
After Midnight	Courtroom Episode	A game is played on the June 18, 2024 edition called Innocent Or Guilty Pleasure, where the cast have to take turns defending one of their guilty pleasures, while the others rotate as prosecutor and judge, in terrible Party City wigs and clip-on ties. It allows for some beautifully Large Ham speeches, especially given that the cast in question is Patton Oswalt, Terry Crews and Joe Manganiello. The game returned the next season, this time with the cast being Dylan Adler, Atsuko Okatsuka, and Reggie Watts.
After Midnight	Cuteness Overload	October 23, 2024 — Taylor attempts to introduce a game involving telling your secrets to a small puppy in an armchair. "Attempts" being the operative word here, since Taylor did not see the tiny little pupper beforehand, and Taylor has to have a crying meltdown at how perfect this sweet little angel is before she can introduce the game properly.
After Midnight	Creepy Doll	Throughout multiple shows, Taylor tries to offer a "haunted" doll her brother gave her as the prize. Each time though, the doll was given back to her despite her pleas. Eventually she manages to give the doll away for real to Marcella Arguello... only for a fan to send Taylor an exact replica of said doll, leading to a later episode where Taylor offers that as a prize while looking absolutely livid. Marcella would proceed to Troll Taylor by bringing the doll back with her on two subsequent appearances, including the Grand Finale!
After Midnight	Cringe Comedy	Max Greenfield. Full stop. He squeezes out a few jokes during his appearance, but most people remember him for being very awkward and out-of-place on this show. They play Kill The Vibe during this episode, where panelists have to make unnecessarily dark/harsh comments on wholesome, heartwarming videos. Max refuses to go that dark and just keeps answering with the most innocuous comments he can think of... which kills the vibe in the studio. Fellow panelist James Davis loves it.
After Midnight	Crowd Chant	
After Midnight	Dark Secret	The point of the game What's Their Secret? Panelists get a stock photo of someone looking shifty-eyed, and have to buzz in with what their secret could be.[image of a man and a woman holding hands, directly behind the back of another girl] Taylor: What's their secret? [chime] Jeff. Jeff Hiller: The middle girl doesn't have a face! [Taylor laughs herself silly] It's probably true!
After Midnight	Darkhorse Victory	Still happens sometimes. Being a big name, or even having a particularly dominant performance during the show, does not guarantee a win.
After Midnight	Death Glare	Taylor developed one on March 6, 2024, when she slowly realized Adam Pally was going to milk his Overly Long Gag for the entire show.
After Midnight	Didn't Think This Through	
After Midnight	Disapproving Look	
After Midnight	Dramatic Gasp	Taylor once introduces a prompt about drama in the needlepoint community (of all places) by gratuitously invoking this.Taylor: Drama is everywhere. Even here. Watch. [cut to camera 2, where an orchestral sting plays while Taylor makes a Dramatic Gasp at the camera] Taylor: [to the audience] Thank you. That'll make more sense later when you watch it at home.
After Midnight	Dude, Not Funny!	During a round of Dumb Dog, Smart Dog, Andy Richter is given a picture of a corgi holding a big branch in its mouth. Andy immediately decides that it's a dumb dog, because corgis are "too low to the ground to be smart." The two significantly shorter panelists next to him, Aparna Nancherla and Thomas Lennon, immediately take offense to this comment, and pause the episode for a moment just to sulk around their podiums. Luckily for Aparna and Tom, the proceeding video shows that very corgi going underneath a gate so it doesn't have to drop the branch — it's a Smart Dog! Aparna actually cheers!Andy: Hoisted by my own petard!
After Midnight	Early-Installment Weirdness	Taylor used to show a TikTok video at the beginning of the episode that would later appear in one of the episode's games. This only lasted the first five weeks of the show. In general, Taylor's intros were also much more brief, and her opening monologue, which is now a mainstay, wouldn't debut until four months in.
After Midnight	Enforced Plug	Played for laughs - one game is about doing an 8 second promo for the show itself, but tailored to specific cities across America.James Adomian: Hey Boston! Go f*ck yourself! After Midnight!
After Midnight	Every Episode Ending	For the first several months, For The Win — the @midnight tradition where the remaining two panelists give anonymous answers to a prompt, and the audience guesses which they like better. After some Retools, we transitioned into The Ultimate Challenge for the final two panelists, which is really just different kinds of guessing games.
After Midnight	Explain, Explain... Oh, Crap!	Taylor was very unhappy finding out that there is, in fact, an After Midnight subreddit.Taylor: This very program has inspired some wonder online. A few days ago, on the After Midnight subreddit [face immediately falls, mid-sentence] which I did not know existed and definitely won't go on later... Matt Rogers: Not good for your mental health. Taylor: No, not at all.
After Midnight	Extreme Close-Up	
After Midnight	Facepalm	The game Make Your Case on February 8, 2024, which concerns taking a real follow a panelist made on social media, and having to defend following that account. After Billy Eichner has been hazing Pete Holmes (because really, who doesn't?) for much of the show, Pete goes up to defend one of his own recent follows... and it's Billy's own account, prompting Billy's face to just collapse into his hands. Thankfully, Pete makes nice and has nothing but glowing words for Billy and his show.
After Midnight	Failed a Spot Check	The final game on October 2, 2024 involved showing a book called "A Light In The Park" on the screen, and asking panelists if it's a real book — they have to stand on either "Real" or "Fake" on the screen floor. Vinny Thomas has this lengthy screed about what he thinks the book is, and picks "Real." Michelle Collins points out that the font for "Fake" perfectly matches the font on the screen, prompting a massive Jaw Drop from Vinny as Michelle stands on "Fake." Of course, Michelle wins, and Vinny's clearly feeling about two inches tall as Michelle celebrates her victory.
After Midnight	Funny Background Event	When contestants are shown a video of a truck souped up with absurdly huge monster truck wheels, Guy Branum and Lisa Gilroy stare in awe, while Marcella Arguello is just throwing ass to the hip-hop song playing in the background.
After Midnight	The Gadfly	
After Midnight	Gallows Humor	October 23, 2024 saw the rare wheelchair user appear as a panelist, comedian Danielle Perez. Besides her podium being lowered to chair height to accommodate her, it passes without mention. Except for one, and it's a doozy — in a game where panelists have to tell all their secrets to a puppy they brought on stage, Taylor asks Danielle to tell the puppy how to make it in Hollywood.Danielle: [stage whisper] Get hit by a train!
After Midnight	Genki Girl	London Hughes, in both her appearances. She's so full of spirit and energy that when she was eliminated in her first episode, the audience practically revolted.
After Midnight	Grand Finale	Aired on Thursday, June 12, 2025, and had the winning panelists from that Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday — Gillian Jacobs, Marcella Arguello and Paul F. Tompkins — come back to compete to become "the winner of After Midnight." And in true After Midnight fashion, it's eventually decided by  an intentionally anticlimactic game of beyblades, which is won by perennial loser Marcella Arguello!
After Midnight	Group Hug	
After Midnight	Guest Host	Taylor was absent from the May 20, 2025 edition to go watch her brother's graduation. Who should step in to host the show? None other than recurring panelist and Dropout icon Lisa Gilroy, who would largely abide by Taylor's usual routine, except when giving out points, which she's unfathomably gratuitous about. By the end of the episode, Caitlin Reilly, Sandy Honig and Jared Goldstein all have over 200,000 points each. Jared points out after getting eliminated that he's "the highest scoring eliminated person of all time."
After Midnight	History Repeats	Two contestants to have competed while pregnant have won — Lauren Lapkus, and then three weeks later, Esther Povitsky. Mandy Moore of all people broke the streak.
After Midnight	Holiday Episode	A few changes to the game format when the show aired on a major holiday event:
After Midnight	Hollywood California	As announcer Laura Peek informs us at the top of each show, it's filmed at Paramount Studios in Hollywood.
After Midnight	Hyperspace Arsenal	Played for Laughs on March 14, 2024 when Reggie Conquest and Jordan Temple both have beanies on, and at some point during the Talk Show Portion, Paul F. Tompkins is suddenly seen wearing a beanie of his own, which he insists he's had on the entire time.
After Midnight	I Need a Freaking Drink	Since After Midnight is often populated by the left-wing, progressive types, there's a palpable bit of gloom hanging over the November 6, 2024 edition, after Kamala Harris lost the election to Donald Trump. Zach Noe Towers and Laura Peek do their best to keep good spirits, but Guy Branum goes the other way — halfway through the episode, when the panelists sit on the couch, Guy changes into pajamas and brings a real bottle of scotch on stage.
After Midnight	Implausible Deniability	Chris Fleming is eliminated on the March 26, 2024 edition, only for him to put a sign up in front of his podium that adds three extra 0s to his point total. So Taylor just decides to eliminate Matt Braunger instead, causing Chris to drop the facade immediately and face his elimination with dignity.
After Midnight	It's the Best Whatever, Ever!	The February 27th, 2024 episode with Caitlin Peluffo, Dulcé Sloan, and Jenny Zigrino had so much wild comedic energy between the three, that it was enough for Taylor to declare it her favorite episode ever before they even went into the first commercial break.
After Midnight	Lady in a Power Suit	Taylor's pantsuits became an instant trademark. She went on to have a variety of outfits as the show progressed into season 2, but her pantsuits remain her most iconic look. So iconic, in fact, that one Reddit user was ranking all her suits ("elite," "goated," "respect," "mid" and "nah") and that post got some airtime in the monologue on June 20, 2024... so Taylor could mercilessly dunk on them as an segue into explaining brainrot.
After Midnight	Large Ham	
After Midnight	Loophole Abuse	On the Super Bowl special, Wayne Brady, Maria Bamford and Kevin Smith had to flick paper footballs through a mock goalpost, getting points for every one that goes through. Maria struggles hard, until she suddenly stops, dumps her box of paper footballs out and just flings them through in bunches ("IT DOESN'T MATTER!!!"), because no one said she couldn't! And thus, she advances to FTW over Wayne Brady and ends the show with a Darkhorse Victory.
After Midnight	Loved by All	Any time Moo Deng (a baby pygmy hippo) comes up, expect everyone, including the studio audience, to react wildly and loudly.
After Midnight	Lucky Charms Title	Still has the @ symbol in the title, but it's more or less The Artifact, as it's still pronounced "after." Adam Pally spent an episode trying to work out the logistics of it (as in, the entire episode).
After Midnight	Meaningful Name	The show is on at 12:37am EST.
After Midnight	Moonwalk Dance	Arden Myrin does a knowingly terrible one on the January 30, 2024 edition, pulling her skirt down over her feet to cover how terrible it is.
After Midnight	Motor Mouth	Downplayed, as Pete Holmes isn't an especially fast talker so much as he's just incessant whenever he starts riffing off one of the game prompts, or off another contestant. Games become longer than normal just because Pete can't help himself. On the September 25, 2024 edition, they played a game where panelists have to fake being asleep one by one and other panelists have to try and stir them awake with jokes and jabs. Jess McKenna simply points out that this is the longest Pete has gone without talking, and Pete's out in five seconds.
After Midnight	My God, What Have I Done?	A comedic version, and twice over! When Kurt Braunohler is eliminated on the March 5th, 2024 edition, Taylor instructs him to call someone he cares about and tell them he lost. Kurt defaults to calling his wife, and in doing so, his wife puts his daughter on the phone. Kurt then has to tell his little girl that "the woman who runs this game made me lose," and she gets immediately upset, so an apologetic Kurt tries in vain to smooth it over and ends the call. An embarrassed Taylor immediately declares they are never doing that again, and she looks a little shaken up going into FTW.
After Midnight	My Parents Are Dead	Brendan Hunt on the February 26th, 2024 edition is asked during the Talk Show Portion what's missing from his life. He casually replies "living parents," breaking the audience's hearts. Thankfully, Marc Maron helpfully(?) chimes in next to him:Marc: I wanna just say that both my parents are still alive, and it's not great. Uh... Brendan: Thank you. Thank you. Marc: You got out, man; you got out. [Beat] I mean to say I'm sorry, for your loss. Brendan: Yeah- you did that in the wrong order. Marc: Yeah, I- I screwed up.
After Midnight	Namesake Gag	Ahead of Super Bowl LVIII, Taylor brings up "prop bets," which are bets not on the outcome of the game, but on strange things like "will Reba McEntire show cleavage while singing the national anthem." (That was really bet on, by the way.) Taylor asks what other prop bets they could make, and Pete Holmes gives us this gem:Pete: Will Usher live up to his namesake and show people to their seats?? [Taylor and the audience bust up laughing] Nico Santos: "These are my concessiooooons..." [audience is set off even more, and Taylor gives Nico an extra 100 points]
After Midnight	NO INDOOR VOICE	Eddie Pepitone's original appearance is a popular one, for his loud New York accent, combined with a penchant for the Rambling Old Man Monologue, swallowing multiple segments whole. Given that he was on with Jessica Kirson and Steph Tolev, two women that are hardly subtle themselves, this is no small feat. Half of the Group Chat is just Eddie shouting his lungs out and screwing up the segment, to the enjoyment of all involved.
After Midnight	"No. Just… No" Reaction	The first episode had a session about questionable cooking methods - one video was about what can only be described as the X-rated version of Saltbae, which got this reaction out of everyone.
After Midnight	Odd Friendship	Drag queen Monet X Change forms a bit of this with bro-comic Adam Ray, and they just riff off each other for homoerotic gags more and more as their episode goes on.
After Midnight	Off the Rails	As the show came into its own, panelists gradually got more comfortable bantering and this happened more and more.
After Midnight	Once an Episode	
After Midnight	The One That Got Away	Played for Laughs by none other than Jerry O'Connell. A game in his January 2024 episode invokes the TikTok meme of "we're girls, of course we ___" and panelists buzz in with variants on this formula. Jerry's becomes very gratuitous.Jerry: We knew each other from high school. Of course I'm gonna find your Instagram page late at night and not follow you but check to see if I'm hotter than your current husband; you had your shot, Amanda; you had your shot and you blew it!!! Taylor: Suck it, Amanda!
After Midnight	Overly Long Gag	
After Midnight	The Points Mean Nothing	Taken to the extent of Self-Deprecation whenever Taylor or a contestant points out that the show is "a fake game show."
After Midnight	Pop-Cultural Osmosis Failure	
After Midnight	Product Placement	Exaggerated on the May 23, 2024 episode, which is, for unexplained reasons, sponsored by Cuervo tequila. It finds its way into many games, the audience hoots and hollers at every mention of it, and everyone has a glass of the stuff during the Talk Show Portion. It's one of those things that gets more gratuitous until it becomes a bit in and of itself.
After Midnight	Proud to Be a Geek	
After Midnight	Pungeon Master	
After Midnight	Recurring Character	
After Midnight	Refuge in Audacity	This segment, where Taylor shows a TikToker named Samantha Hart, who explains that the formatting of her work email means that it shortens to... well, "shart." Taylor is quick to point out that they legally can't say that on TV, and in response, W. Kamau Bell, followed by Nish Kumar, starts chanting "SHART! SHART! SHART! SHART! SHART!" and getting the audience to join in, leaving Taylor in a fit of giggles.
After Midnight	Retool	
After Midnight	Rule of Three	Once during the Talk Show Portion, Taylor asked "what are three things that scare you?" to all three panelists, to everyone's amusement.
After Midnight	The Runner-Up Takes It All	As the person eliminated is given some kind of punishment — really just a prompt to make up some kind of losing speech or skit — it's been argued by viewers that the real winners are the ones who get a whole segment to themselves on the way out, and they're often more memorable than FTW. The episode with Esther Povitsky isn't memorable so much for her winning the episode, as it is for Kurt Braunohler's infamous phone call to his family to tell them he lost (which, to Taylor's horror, made his daughter upset for real). Maria Bamford once sacrificed some points to Laurie Kilmartin just so she could do an elimination... and go home early, of course. In the extreme case, Marcella Arguello used her elimination from her first appearance to start a bit that lasted through the end credits.
After Midnight	Running Gag	
After Midnight	Sarcasm Mode	Taylor asks Penn Jillette on the May 22, 2024 Talk Show Portion what it's like "being mightier than the sword." (Get it? Because his name is "Penn.") Penn Jillette responds by going full Sarcasm Mode for several minutes just to make fun of Taylor for such a lame joke.
After Midnight	Scenery Porn	The simple-looking yet dynamic set, with the big flip-phone main monitor, surrounded by translucent glass panels and lights that change vibrant colors depending on the situation.
After Midnight	Screw the Rules, I Make Them!	Downplayed, Taylor doesn't invoke this nearly as often as her predecessor did, save for one occasion where she said that in rehearsals, she found a game's rules complicated enough that she made the game worth 200 points instead of 100. She'll also award points in the Talk Show Portion if someone says something clever or interesting enough, even though it's not supposed to be a competitive segment.
After Midnight	Self-Deprecation	Taylor Tomlinson's stand-up jokes about her own struggles with mental health extend to this show, and contestants sometimes follow suit.
After Midnight	Sequel Series	To the original @Midnight, with frequent guests of the original showing up here, as well as some more recent faces in comedy, Taylor included.
After Midnight	Serious Business	May 20, 2024's edition features a game called Is It Caked? where panelists have to guess whether inanimate objects found online have a butt on them, aka Caked or Not Caked. Rory Scovel takes the game so seriously that it becomes sublimely ridiculous (in other words, extremely Rory Scovel).Rory: NONE OF YOU ARE ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK like I am! YOU DON'T KNOW HOW HARD this is! If I don't win, they're gonna kill my family! YOU HAVE IT EASY!!! [Taylor has to wipe her eyes from laughing]
After Midnight	Shirtless Scene	January 30, 2024's edition had a game called Better Life/Worse Life, where contestants are shown TikToks of some very eccentric influencers, and have to elaborate on why their lives are better or worse than them. The last one is a shirtless, muscle-bound guy in white jeans spraying perfume on himself. Jerry O'Connell chimed in proclaiming his life was better than this man's, by taking off his shirt and showing off his dad bod while dancing to the same stock music. Arden Myrin and Mary Lynn Rajskub get on the floor and do the worm around him just to be a part of... whatever this is, and thus everyone gets points. Jerry is made to take off his shirt again for a later segment.
After Midnight	Shout-Out	Six people saw a documentary about clowns that terrorise people... What I like about it is that you can light up a kids' room, or a sewer. And I saw it and I was like, this is it. (Beat) I said THIS IS IT!
After Midnight	Shout-Out to Shakespeare	April '24 - Jack Martin is eliminated, and his punishment is to give his idea of the "To be or not to be" speech from Hamlet. While holding Yorick's skull for some reason.
After Midnight	Sincerity Mode	Discussed in the final week of episodes, when Affion Crockett tries to be sincere in being thankful to get to be on the show, only for Marcella Arguello and Milana Vayntrub to instinctively joke about it, and Taylor can't help but laugh about how comedians are so bad at being sincere.
After Midnight	Sleepyhead	One challenge on the January 27, 2025 episode has the panelists help "stan" an adorable hamster. Unfortunately, it gets a little difficult since Taylor says that the hamster is frequently falling asleep throughout most of the challenge.
After Midnight	Sore Loser	Played for Laughs by a few eliminated contestants.
After Midnight	Special Guest	Occasionally someone who is not a panelist will show up just for a specific segment.
After Midnight	Speed Round	Hashtag Wars is still this, and sometimes there's another game of this nature in the elimination round.
After Midnight	Spelling Bee	Discussed when comedian Chloe Radcliffe dropped the word "fuselage" in one of her answers, and when Chris Fleming called her on using such a big word, Chloe claimed she won the 8th grade spelling bee. She demonstrates by spelling 'fuselage' to a big round of applause... even though, as Taylor points out, no one knows if she's right. (She was.) Moments later she then successfully spells "prosopometamorphopsia" ...by cheating and reading it off the big screen, with an irritated Taylor trying to cover the last few syllables.
After Midnight	Springtime for Hitler	Taylor's been up front on many occasions that the Talk Show Portion was intended as a Take That, Audience!note because at first many people thought she'd be hosting a talk show, and wouldn't get over it for the show's first few weeks, and the irony was not lost on Taylor when the segment gradually developed into a fan favorite. She embraced it, and it went from a one-minute goof-off with Seinfeldian Conversation to a fuller segment allowing the panelists to riff off each other a bit, and maybe even watch an extra video a panelist found on social media, just for fun. For Season 2, it's now used usually as a lead-in for Couch Game.
After Midnight	Squee	Taylor tries to go into the Talk Show Portion on July 18, 2024, but needs to take a moment to lose her mind over the fact that Mandy Moore is here! Mandy's a good sport and just lets Taylor gush for a minute about how Mandy's in so many of her comfort-watches.
After Midnight	The Stoner	
After Midnight	Stylistic Suck	
After Midnight	Take That, Audience!	Inspired by internet trolls who blasted the show initially for not being another late night talk show, Taylor started the Talk Show Portion, an interview segment with the three contestants that's usually as inane and arbitrary as possible. At the very least, it's just something else for comedians to riff off of, and at most it's an opportunity for a contestant to promote a current project.note Taylor once tried to promote her own comedy special during this segment, but cringed so much in doing so that she openly begged the contestants to plug their own projects so she doesn't "feel perceived." Taylor has even spelled out explicitly that she never had any interest in doing a talk show.Taylor: Well, that wraps up the Talk Show Portion; are you animals satisfied?!
After Midnight	Technologically Blind Elders	Averted by Caroline Rhea; when asked to identify what an NPC is for a game, she knows her daughter's video gaming habits so well that she gets it right off the bat (punctuated with a sassy hair flip for good measure). Not bad considering Caroline is pushing 60 by the time of this episode.
After Midnight	That Came Out Wrong	The first repeat guest, Kurt Braunohler, during the Talk Show Portion on March 5, 2024, is asked if anything's happened since last appearing, and he tells this unfortunate tale:Kurt: And then on the way home, I took an Uber, and I was getting out of the car, I just was like "Thank you so much," and I was leaving and he just instinctually went "Love you too." Taylor: Ohhhhh, that's amazing for you and terrible for him! Kurt: Yeah, and then I just closed the door and was like, "he didn't mean to do that." Taylor: Ohhh, five stars. Did you tip really big? Kurt: No, I gave him one star and said he's gross.
After Midnight	That Reminds Me of a Song	The Super Bowl special brings on internet sensation Marc Rebillet for "After Midnight's first ever halftime show" and it's an improvised EDM track about all the different things that happen in football, delivered in stream-of-consciousness as only Marc Rebillet can.
After Midnight	Trapped in TV Land	In the Halloween Episode: Marcella Arguello wins a haunted book. After opening it up, the lights go out and when they turn back on, Marcella is trapped in the giant flip-phone monitor, making her wonder if she's going viral.
After Midnight	Troll	
After Midnight	Unseen No More	Season 2 debuts the show's announcer, comedian and voice actor Laura Peek, and a few weeks in, she shows up on camera as a full-fledged contestant, to fill in for an absent Moses Storm. She wastes no time in making fun of her own announcing voice.Laura: The voice is controlling me now!
After Midnight	Vaudeville Hook	They actually used one of these to eliminate Catherine Cohen on the May 6, 2024 edition. With an old timey piano vamp playing in the background.
After Midnight	Victory Pose	Usually the episode's winner just pumps their hands in the air, but Zach Noe Towers' epic Darkhorse Victory, over heretofore dominant Beth Stelling, results in him outstretching his arms and doing a perfectly flamboyant spin, and he earned it.
After Midnight	Walking Shirtless Scene	
After Midnight	Waxing Lyrical	May 23 2024 - they do a "complete the quote" game with popular toasts, starting with one that goes "To health, to happiness..."Marcella: To the window, to the wall.
After Midnight	Weird Aside	A standby joke for Taylor and many contestants, but mastered by Dave Hill in his appearance — his were extremely weird and demented asides, often about legal troubles and at one point hinting at bestiality (as one does).
After Midnight	Wiki Walk	February 13 2024 - the elimination round is about guessing how many clicks to get from one Wiki page to another.
Agatha All Along	Creative Closing Credits	The end credits sequence is a smorgasbord of witch imagery, including not only the above-mentioned Old Hag and Lisa as a witch, but also many women dressed in witch costumes, pages from books about witchcraft and the Wizard of Oz, and even a snippet of footage from The Craft.  Notably, the final two episodes replace the last three shots of the credits featuring a forest environment with shots of Billy's bedroom after he realizes the Witches' Road was subconsciously created by him and is based on items in his bedroom.
Agent Carter	I Work Alone	Peggy's attitude at the beginning of the series, especially after her roommate Colleen is killed. Luckily, Jarvis talks her out of this mentality.
After Midnight	Zonk	The prizes for winning an episode are always underwhelming or just plain odd. Prizes have included: a creepy doll (offered multiple times because the winners keep giving it back), a Ziploc bag of ranch dressing, a fresh batch of socks, a broken rolling chair, Taylor's father's approval, a pair of jeans with the security device still on them that Taylor swears they did not steal, a dental goodie bag, a bunch of ketchup packets Taylor was keeping in her fridge, a free trip to Loomis, Nebraska, a catalytic converter, a page from Taylor's old diary, a bag of bags, a pet rock, a deflated basketball, and a vintage magazine from the 50s entitled Good Housewife. That being said, there are some prizes that avert this, such as boxer shorts signed by Tom Brady, fully functioning night vision goggles, a basket of donuts and beer, an emergency survival kit, and a Prada handbag.
Agatha All Along	Adaptational Nationality	Alice Wu-Gulliver is Asian-American. Her comic book counterpart is a Hong Kong native with a British dad and dual nationality.
Agatha All Along	Adaptation Name Change	Downplayed Trope: In the comics Alice's surname is just Gulliver, and "the Wu" is her magical title.
Agatha All Along	Adaptation Title Change	In-universe. The credits for Agnes of Westview state it is based on a Danish show called Wandavisdysen.
Agatha All Along	Advertising by Association	As can be seen on Agatha All Along's poster, it's advertised as being "from the twisted minds that brought you WandaVision", being a direct follow-up to that show and sharing much of its cast and crew.
Agatha All Along	Alchemy Is Magic	Jennifer Kale's magic is said to focus on potions and alchemy.
Agatha All Along	All for Nothing	The series confirms that both Billy and Tommy still exist in this universe. Moreover, Billy gained a new body for himself and figures out how to do the same for Tommy as well. This means Wanda's rampage in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, driven by her wanting to be with her sons, was all for naught. Had she stayed near Westview while working to master her chaos magic, Billy would have found her.
Agatha All Along	Alliterative Title	Agatha All Along.
Agatha All Along	Always Night	The Witches' Road seems to be cast in perpetual nighttime, which is lampshaded by "Teen."
Agatha All Along	Ambiguously Absent Parent	
Agatha All Along	Ascended Fanboy	The "Teen" has been studying Agatha's life ever since her days in Salem, which is why he decided to free her from Wanda's spell. Except that was a lie. He sought Agatha out because of her involvement in the Westview anomaly.
Agatha All Along	As Long as It Sounds Foreign	"Wandavisdysen" translates from Danish as "Wanda Wise Nozzle."
Agatha All Along	Aspect Ratio Switch	This happens during the first two trials, though not the third trial for some reason, as well as an extended flashback in Episode 6.
Agatha All Along	Avengers Assemble	Agatha puts together a coven of witches with different specialties to walk the Witches Road. This includes alchemist Jennifer Kale, divination witch Lilia, protection witch Alice, and "green witch" Sharon Davisnote However, she's just a substitute, as the actual green witch is supposed to be Rio Vidal.
Agatha All Along	Bait-and-Switch	
Agatha All Along	Bait-and-Switch Credits	The first episode features an opening credits sequence based on a faux crime procedural Television Show called Agnes of Westview. This is a nod to the many themed opening credits seen in WandaVision (with faux credits parodying the previous show as an alleged Danish Television show called "Wandavisdysen").
Agatha All Along	Belated Injury Realization	In Episode 4, the Wu family's curse causes "Teen" to be thrown through a glass studio window. At first, he appears to be uninjured from the attack. However, a few minutes later, "Teen" realizes there is a shard of glass stuck in his abdomen while he's performing a cover of Lorna's Ballad.
Agatha All Along	Black Cloak	The Salem Seven are all dressed in black hoods, which is a fitting for a coven of witches who want to get back at Agatha.
Agatha All Along	Black Dude Dies First	Averted. Jennifer Kale, the black woman in Agatha's coven, regains her previously-bound magic and lives to tell the tale.
Agatha All Along	Bookends	Episode 7 begins and ends with Lilia falling to her death at the end of her trial.
Agatha All Along	Butt-Monkey	"Teen" has it pretty rough. From being hit by a car while trying to run away from "Agnes," to being Bound and Gagged in her closet, and generally having to be a pawn in her process of assembling a coven.
Agatha All Along	Call-Back	
Agatha All Along	Canon Character All Along	
Agatha All Along	Cast Full of Gay	Half of the main cast are confirmed as queer. While Agatha and Rio are two women (or presenting as such anyway, given Rio's Death itself) who were once girlfriends, Teen's a gay guy with a boyfriend. Jennifer and Alice both indicate that they might like women as well, and if it's true, it'd put LGBT+ characters in a solid majority for the main cast.
Agatha All Along	Casting Gag	
Agatha All Along	Changing Clothes Is a Free Action	Whenever the group enters a new trial, their clothes are changed, they're cleaned up from any filth gained on the trial, and their hairstyles are changed to fit the setting. Given the first trial requires strands of hair from people, it's implied that Jen's hair was not in fact a wig but real hair. The changes and cleanliness vanish just the same.
Agatha All Along	Classical Elements Ensemble	Agatha sings "Gather sisters - fire, water, earth, and air" while looking at Alice, Jen, Sharon, and Lilia respectively. Sharon is later replaced by Rio, who also fits the element of earth as the green witch.
Agatha All Along	Clothing Damage	Happens to nearly everyone during their trip down the Road. While the trials provide them a respite by dressing them in whole new looks, their clothes always revert once they've exited, along with all the damage they've acquired along the Road so far. Jen, Lilia, and Agatha get the worst of it after  Billy hits his Rage Breaking Point and tosses them all into a bog. They spend the rest of their time on the Road utterly drenched in mud, and Agatha is forced to ditch her Badass Longcoat.
Agatha All Along	Closest Thing We Got	Sharon Davis doesn't know anything about magic and may not have any magical potential, but she has a nice garden and at one point was known as Mrs. Hart, so Agatha picks her as the "green witch signified by a heart in black ink" to avoid including Rio Vidal in her coven. It winds up just getting Sharon killed, meaning Rio has to be summoned anyway.
Agatha All Along	Company Cross-References	
Agatha All Along	The Con	The finale reveals the Witches' Road was the centerpiece of one, with the legend of the fictitious Road stemming from a song created by Agatha and Nicholas. After Nicholas' death, a witch approached a grieving Agatha for help getting to the Road, and the latter opportunistically repurposed the song to draw other witches to her so she could steal their magic.
Agatha All Along	Dangerously Garish Environment	The first trial of the Witches' Road happens in a gorgeous beach vacation house with bright pastel colors and a welcome note written on beautiful card stock. It also contains a test that involves finding the antidote to a deadly poison they are made to ingest. Among the poison's horrifying symptoms are face swelling, dizziness, hallucinations of fears/traumatic events, heart palpitations, and eventual death.
Agatha All Along	Dark Reprise	The Ballad's Agatha Through Time Version, which is featured in Episode 9, sounds increasingly malevolent and oppressive as it goes on. This accompanies The Reveal that after Nicholas died in his sleep, Agatha used the song to lure in and then murder countless covens over the centuries.
Agatha All Along	Deliberately Monochrome	As Wanda's spell on her to be in her "Agnes" persona is broken, Agatha cycles through her appearances from WandaVision—including her black and white appearance from its first episode—while her surroundings remain in color.
Agatha All Along	De-power	
Agatha All Along	Deuteragonist	"Teen" gets the second amount of plot focus, after Agatha.
Agatha All Along	Divine Date	Agatha and Rio once dated, while they still have feelings for each other. Rio turns out to be Death, while Agatha is human.
Agatha All Along	Dwindling Party	Not everyone who travels the Road makes it out alive. By the end, only Agatha, Billy, and Jen survive the journey itself while Sharon, Alice, and Lilia die during the trials. Agatha also sacrifices herself to Death in order to save Billy's life.Rio: The bodies are really piling up!
Agatha All Along	Elemental Motifs	The Ballad of the Witches' Road names the four classical elements—fire, water, earth and air. The visualizer for the Ballad shows images of Alice, Jennifer, Rio, and Lilia flash in the crystal ball in that order during that verse.
Agatha All Along	Enchanted Forest	The dimension of the Witches' Road seems to have this as its natural aesthetic, which is fitting since in many stories and fairy tales, the woods are a known area where witches make their lairs. It also has elements of Don't Go in the Woods and Genius Loci, the latter especially when Agatha notes that the Road changes itself to fit the coven traveling it.
Agatha All Along	The Ending Changes Everything	The last two episodes reveal there was never a Witches' Road until the events of the series. The Ballad started out as a tune Agatha and Nicholas made up that spread beyond the taverns they visited, with the ensuing rumors evolving offscreen into the legend about the Road. After her son's death, Agatha took advantage of the legend, forming covens who tried to conjure a door to the nonexistent Road before goading the conned witches into attacking her so she could steal their magic. The Road which Agatha's coven had been traveling on was a hex (much like the Westview anomaly) created by Billy, who subconsciously drew inspiration from stuff in his bedroom.
Agatha All Along	Everyone Calls Him "Barkeep"	Billy is only referred to as "Teen" by Agatha and the coven. Justified since a sigil prevents them from learning his real name until later on.
Agatha All Along	Fallen-on-Hard-Times Job	The witches Agatha recruits for her quest all had misfortune in their lives and are unable or unwilling to use their magic to make a living.
Agatha All Along	Foe Romance Subtext	Agatha's interactions with Rio—especially in "Agnes of Westview" and their fight after Agatha is free of Wanda's spell—have a heavy dose of homoerotic subtext, making them come across as ex-girlfriends. This gets stronger when they meet again in Episode 4, and Rio heavily implies that Agatha is her ex-girlfriend, which is fully confirmed in Episode 7.
Agatha All Along	Foreshadowing	Has its own page.
Agatha All Along	Gambit Pileup	It transpires that Agatha, Billy, and Rio were all running their own plans while trying to keep the others in the dark. Agatha was originally just trying to form a fake coven and then drain them dry with the promise of the nonexistent Witches' Road, but after she correctly suspected Teen to be Billy and subconsciously using a reality-warping hex, she uses it to escape the Salem Seven and try to regain her magic. Billy is trying to use Agatha's knowledge or the Quest for a Wish of the Witches' Road to find Tommy. Meanwhile, Rio/Death can't reap Agatha or Billy herself due to a past agreement with Agatha and Billy's Resurrective Immortality, so she aims to make one of them give themselves up to her.
Agatha All Along	Generational Trauma	Alice's grandmother as well as her mother died from a curse that has been plaguing their matrilineal lineage for generations. This resulted in Alice almost dying as a child and growing up to hate magic, but being aimless in life. In Episode 4, her trial means she must literally and figuratively fight the curse on her family.
Agatha All Along	Genius Loci	Agatha says the Witches' Road changes depending on the coven walking it. The series bears this out in a few ways.
Agatha All Along	Genre Shift	In-universe, as the spell imprisoning Agatha has shifted from sitcoms of various eras to a crime thriller with Agatha as the detective.
Agatha All Along	Godiva Hair	Once Wanda's spell is broken, Agatha is revealed to be completely naked, with her hair covering her breasts. This continues after she goes outside without bothering to put on some clothes first.
Agatha All Along	Grey-and-Grey Morality	
Agatha All Along	The Grim Reaper	Rio is revealed in Episode 7 to be the incarnation of death and decay.
Agatha All Along	The Hecate Sisters	Triple Goddess symbolism crops up all over the place, from the image on Agatha's brooch to the "Maiden, Mother, Crone" line in the Ballad.
Agatha All Along	Idiosyncratic Episode Naming	Every episode is named after a lyric or two from a version of "The Ballad of the Witches' Road". Notably, "If I Can't Reach You / Let My Song Teach You" is the only one that isn't in the Sacred Chant version, as it comes from a verse exclusive to the Lorna Wu version which is featured in that episode.
Agatha All Along	In Medias Res	The events of Episode 7 are shown out of order to demonstrate Lilia's perspective of her powers. While her actions are linear to herself, her mind travels backward and forward in time.
Agatha All Along	Jump Scare	"Teen" gets hit with this in-universe in the second episode after he blocks the open door to Agatha's house from the Salem Seven, only for one of them to burst through a window and claw at him.
Agatha All Along	Killed Offscreen	Sharon mentions that her husband Todd died sometime after the events of WandaVision.
Agatha All Along	Kung-Fu Wizard	Alice Wu-Gulliver is a protection witch. She's an ex-cop who's also capable of hand-to-hand combat.
Agatha All Along	Logo Joke	The Marvel Television logo is rendered in white against a black background surrounded by the branches of a purple tree.
A Haunting	Big Fancy House	Usually at low, low prices.
A Haunting	Cat Scare	In "Demon Child", the older daughter is briefly startled by her pet cat.
Agatha All Along	Magical Barefooter	Upon arriving on the Witches' Road, everyone follows Agatha's lead in taking off their shoes once they start the journey; a glimpse of a book in the Creative Closing Credits states that witches attempting the Road must remove their footwear. Subverted. There's no Road, and there is no need to remove one's shoes. However, witches roaming on the Road barefoot does complete the look and helps to sell Agatha's con. That said, Rio/Death is the real deal, con or no con.
Agatha All Along	Magic Music	
Agatha All Along	Make Way for the New Villains	The Salem Seven die during Lilia's trial in Episode 7, making room for Rio/Death to become Episode 8's main antagonist—and the series' Final Boss.
Agatha All Along	Meaningful Name	Besides the series' title being a Call-Back, it's revealed in Episode 9 that the concept of the fictional Witches' Road came from a song created by Agatha and Nicholas. After Nicholas died, a grief-stricken Agatha repurposed the song to ensnare gullible witches who took it at face value, meaning it really was Agatha all along.
Agatha All Along	Mid-Season Twist	The Reveal that "Teen" is Billy Maximoff shakes up the story by introducing a new heavy-hitting major player and completely changing the dynamic between the two main characters.
Agatha All Along	Muggle with a Degree in Magic	Agatha and Jenn have both lost their powers but they still have their knowledge. They are still capable of "analog magic" such as potion-brewing and rituals.
Agatha All Along	Ms. Fanservice	In Alice's trial, the cast end up wearing 70s costumes. Rio's is a plunging neckline that goes straight to Florida, and Agatha's isn't even a neckline, it's just an open velvet coat that has to be held on with tape. Lilia's neckline is quite modest by comparison, but still heaves up her bosom to show generous cleavage. All three are showing off the girls. Witch out with your tits out, ladies. And then there's Agatha in the first episode, getting her memories back and storming out of her house naked. Her modesty is protected from the front only by Godiva Hair and Scenery Censor, but when she turns around to go back into her house, there is no modesty to be had.
Agatha All Along	Naïve Newcomer	Sharon Davis (a.k.a. Mrs. Hart) is recruited into the coven as the green witch since Agatha doesn't want to recruit Rio Vidal. She clearly has no idea what's going on and is told she's being invited to a party.
Agatha All Along	Naked People Are Funny	In the first episode, after Agatha regains her memories, she runs outside to talk to John Collins naked. Her nonchalance and frustrated ranting is played for laughs. Of course she sports Godiva Hair while all this happens.
Agatha All Along	No Good Deed Goes Unpunished	A running theme of Agatha's coven is all its members are jaded or in their miserable positions because they tried using their powers or abilities for good, only for it to blow up in their faces:
Agatha All Along	Off to See the Wizard	The gathering of various companions to journey down a road through a magical land so everyone can fulfill their hearts' desires is a clear reference, not to mention the prominence of witches. Also manifested in a few key ShoutOuts: Herb refers to the dead body in the first episode as "really most sincerely dead," and Agatha calls "Teen" "Toto" in episode 2. The Witches' Road is lined with autumn leaves, close enough to yellow brick. Illustrations from the Oz books can be seen in the ending credits montage among many other depictions of witches from history and pop culture. Much like the source material there is a running theme of It Was with You All Along and You Are Better Than You Think You Are in the questing characters realizing their goals.
Agatha All Along	The One Guy	Naturally being a show about witches, the main cast is made up mostly of women, with Joe Locke's "Teen" being the only major male cast member.
Agatha All Along	Perky Goth	"Teen" dresses in all black and wears dark makeup, but he's very energetic and has a bit of a Motor Mouth.
Agatha All Along	Please Put Some Clothes On	John tries to give Agatha his coat to wear while she's talking to him naked. She angrily shoves it away and storms back into her house, still skyclad.
Agatha All Along	Pragmatic Adaptation	The series adapts Billy Kaplan for the MCU with changes to account for the lack of a sliding timescale. In the comics, Billy Kaplan is Billy Maximoff's soul reborn into a new family, having grown up unaware of his origin. In the show, William Kaplan is unrelated to Billy, except that he died in a car crash just as the Hex disappeared, allowing Billy to inhabit his body. Same concept, but it accounts for the much shorter time gap.
Agatha All Along	Queer Establishing Moment	
Agatha All Along	Quicksand Sucks	Whenever anyone walks off the Road, the ground beneath them becomes bubbling muck that sucks them down.
Agatha All Along	Ragtag Bunch of Misfits	
Agatha All Along	Red Herring	
Agatha All Along	Repurposed Pop Song	Playing throughout the trailer is "Seven Devils" by Florence + the Machine.
Agatha All Along	Rewatch Bonus	
Agatha All Along	Running Gag	Everyone keeps calling Sharon Davis "Mrs. Hart," her name in the titular in-universe sitcom of WandaVision. In particular, Agatha keeps forgetting her real name to the point that every time someone mentions Sharon after her death, she asks who she is.
Agatha All Along	Same Plot Sequel	In a sense, it's one to WandaVision. A Maximoff witch serves as a lead character and wields chaos magic. The witch inadvertently creates an enormous mystical creation beyond anyone's normal capabilities as a way to regain who they didn't have in their life. That creation causes numerous issues for the main characters as they try to navigate it while two external forces infiltrate it for their own purposes, one of whom appears to be an ally before their true identity's revealed and they prove to be the series' Final Boss. The series ends with the Maximoff lead heading out into the world, having awakened to their magic's true power while a reincarnated loved one still lives out there somewhere.
Agatha All Along	Serial Killer	Episode 5 features Jennifer calling Agatha a "noted serial killer" after Rio defends her while Lilia explains the Salem Seven's origins. Episode 9 all but confirms that she's killed hundreds—if not thousands—of fellow witches before she investigated the Westview anomaly, using The Con about the Road to draw them to her and get them to lower their guard.
Agatha All Along	Shout-Out	
Agatha All Along	Shoo Out the Clowns	Sharon Davis is the series' Muggle and Plucky Comic Relief who's in over her head. She's also the first to die, and her death marks the point where the series starts to progressively get darker.
Agatha All Along	Shown Their Work	The "Ballad of the Witches' Road" song almost perfectly mimics the style of medieval vocal music, which is fitting for a song that's hundreds of years old.
A Haunting	Christianity Is Catholic	Averted. Catholic priests do appear to perform exorcisms, but other types of ministers also help combat the hauntings.
Agatha All Along	Spin-Off	The series serves as a spin-off of WandaVision, with the spotlight being on the previous show's Breakout Villain, Agatha Harkness. Officially, however, it is the second part of a trilogy that comprises WandaVision, Agatha All Along, and Vision Quest, and the ending of the show reveals it as a Stealth Sequel to WandaVision.
Agatha All Along	Stay on the Path	The first major rule when walking the Witches' Road, as emphasized by the lyric "I stray not from the path" in the Ballad. Sharon finds this out the hard way when she wanders off from the group and nearly gets taken by a bog that bubbles up from nowhere.
Agatha All Along	Stealth Sequel	While it was obviously a spin-off of WandaVision, it was not immediately clear until the last few episodes that it was also a thematic sequel to it (a Season 2 of sorts). Both share the same basic premise, with the main characters ending up in an artificial reality created by a powerful being, with both realities being a coping mechanism for their trauma that draws on stuff which they are fond of.
Agatha All Along	Stop Being Stereotypical	
Agatha All Along	Teeth-Clenched Teamwork	The only reason Agatha, Lilia, Jen, and Alice are working together is because they all want something from the Witches' Road, and the Road requires a coven. Lilia, Jen, and Alice openly distrust Agatha, and Agatha antagonizes them a lot. The only person who actively wants to hang out with and work with Agatha is "Teen," and Agatha barely tolerates him.
Agatha All Along	Titled After the Song	The show's title comes from Agatha's Villain Song from WandaVision.
Agatha All Along	Token Good Teammate	While Agatha is unabashedly more villainous, and Lilia and Jen aren't terribly bad (Jen's main flaw is being a Dirty Coward, but she is not actively malicious), Alice and "Teen" stick out as the more heroic members of the coven. They both rush to Sharon's aid when she is getting sucked into the mud, they insist that she not be left behind when the beach house is flooding and she is apparently still unconscious from the poison, and they take the time to give her a proper burial. Alice is also the one to run to defend "Teen" when he is tackled by one of the Salem Seven, and tries to save Agatha from her ghostly mother. Meanwhile, "Teen" serves as Agatha's Morality Pet, is the only one who refuses to turn on her when the coven is told to do so in order to pass the third Trial, and takes his time to ensure that Lilia gets out of the beach house despite her reluctance to go through the oven exit.
Agatha All Along	Tomato Surprise	Whereas Agatha and Rio are aware as to what's really going on as early as potentially Episode 2, the other characters (and the series' viewers) only get the full context starting in Episode 6. "Teen" is a reincarnated Billy, who wants to find Tommy and accidentally created a hex with his own chaos magic that made the Witches' Road real for the first time. The originally-fictional Road was the core of a con by Agatha to drain other witches' magic. Rio is Death herself, and she eventually tries to make either Agatha or Billy willingly go with her to the afterlife—as both are currently unkillable due to her pact with her ex-girlfriend and his reincarnation abilities respectively.
Agatha All Along	Tongue-Tied	"Teen" has a type of redaction spell called a sigil on him that causes witches to be unable to learn anything about who he is. When he tries to say his name, Agatha and the other witches see his mouth briefly disappearing. It's taken to an extreme when "Teen" talks about his past, but in Agatha's perspective, his voice becomes audibly blurred out. She can hear herself snapping her fingers and the music on his car's radio, but she's unable to hear a word of what he's saying.
Agatha All Along	Town with a Dark Secret	Westview has become this. The outside world believes the Hex was just an Avengers training exercise gone wrong. The residents of Westview are so traumatized by what happened that they refuse to talk to outsiders about it and even avoid saying Wanda's name.
Agatha All Along	Trailers Always Spoil	Trailers for the show often feature several scenes from the final two episodes. It includes Agatha and Billy sitting on the floor of the final trial performing a ritual (Billy finding a body for Tommy), Rio being ready to confront Agatha, and Jen emerging from the ground outside of Westview after escaping the Witches' Road.
Agatha All Along	Truer to the Text	Agatha eventually gains her comic book appearance, with the grey and a more comic-accurate costume, in this series. But it's only after she dies and becomes a ghost that she does.
Agatha All Along	Uncertain Doom	It's left unclear if Wanda is truly dead. Agatha sees her body, but only in her Hex hallucination; "Teen" demands to know if anyone else saw it, and she can't answer. Rio says that the Scarlet Witch is "gone" without being more specific; per Word of God, that wording was deliberate. Especially considering that Rio is Death and would know if she actually ushered Wanda through the veil.
Agatha All Along	Unrelated in the Adaptation	In the comics, the Salem Seven were Agatha's grandchildren. Here, they are the children of Agatha's original coven.
Agatha All Along	Villain Protagonist	The Big Badnote or rather, one of them, since Wanda was the Villain Protagonist of that show of WandaVision is the titular star of this show—and she's just as duplicitous, callous, and proudly antagonistic as ever. The only difference is that she no longer has her magic, so she's (ostensibly) less dangerous.
Agatha All Along	We ARE Struggling Together	The Road is supposed to be completed by a coven acting in unison. However, the witches Agatha assembled for her quest are loners who do not get along well with others. Even when in mortal danger, they still take the time to bicker and turn on each other. It does not help matters that Agatha is constantly insulting and antagonizing everyone around her. "Teen" has to constantly call them out on it and the fact that such behavior will get them killed. Ultimately justified as Agatha was trying to goad them into attacking her so she could steal their powers.
Agatha All Along	Wham Line	
Agatha All Along	What Happened to the Mouse?	Señor Scratchy isn't seen after the coven enters the Road.
Agatha All Along	Whole Episode Flashback	Most of Episode 6 is a flashback showing Billy Maximoff possessed William Kaplan's corpse and the real reason he decided to walk the Road.
Agatha All Along	Xanatos Speed Chess	It isn't obvious until the end, but it turns out that Agatha is a master of this trope. Although she initially dismisses Teen, who truly believes in the Road's existence, Agatha quickly suspects that he's a reincarnated Billy. With Billy's help, she quickly throws together a coven of has-beens so she can steal their magic just as she's done to countless other covens since 1756. When the Witches' Road actually makes itself known, she goes along with it, pretending to be a seasoned traveler of the Road. The rest of Agatha's journey consists of rapidly improvising attempts to escape from the Witches' Road, to exploit any opportunities she finds, and to steal the powers of her coven.
A Killer Paradox	Villain Protagonist	Lee Tang and Roh bin in Anti-Villain and Anti-Hero genre
Agatha All Along	Your Mind Makes It Real	The Witches' Road never existed, being part of a con Agatha made up to lure witches in and drain them, particularly after Nicholas' passing locked her into Then Let Me Be Evil. So what about the Road shown across seven episodes? It's all part of a hex subconsciously made by Billy and tinted by his fascination with witchcraft.
Agatha Raisin	Adaptation Dye-Job	The books make a lot out of Agatha's brunette hair looking great, but the TV adaptation uses Ashley Jensen's blonde hair for Agatha. On the inverse, Toni is blonde in the books but brunette in the TV show.
Agatha Raisin	Adaptational Expansion	While the character of Mrs. Josephs only appeared in one book, the TV show has her appear in most episodes of the 1st series, so that her murder in The Vetted Vet would hit as that more shocking.

A prophecy predicts that a curse on the family line will be broken when a "raven" takes power; and the suspect, who has dark hair, believes this refers to her.

A Haunting	Demonic Possession	Several of the episodes have some form of this. In the episode "The Exorcism of Cindy Sauer", this happens to the titular Cindy and it gets to the point where her son loses his faith because of it. Unfortunately, while the entity was exorcised, it still keeps coming back.
A Haunting	Don't Go in the Woods	In "Dark Forest", the family buys a house located in the New Yorkan countryside, surrounded by forest.

This usually doesn't end well for the animals; in one episode, a horse had to be put down, and in "A Haunting in Georgia", the family dog ran away and the family never found him.
A Haunting	Exorcism	Usually, in some form or another. It's easier to count the episodes where one doesn't happen, however, it has varying levels of success. In one episode, they use a smudging instead of an exorcism.

A Haunting	Ghostly Goals	More often than not, the ghosts have something tying them into the living world.

A Haunting	Ghost Story	The premise of the show.

A Haunting	Mama Bear	Weirdly enough, we get this from a ghost in "Sallie's House" when the ghost of Sallie's mother attacks the husband of the family, not of the mother, because, according to the psychic, the husband wouldn't accept Sallie (he didn't believe in ghosts).
A Haunting	Monster Clown	One of the illusions that a haunted house creates to scare its owner's child's friend is a phantom clown.
A Haunting	Not-So-Imaginary Friend	The episodes "Demon Child" and "A Haunting in Georgia" have the parents thinking that the entities their kids talk to are imaginary friends. They're dead wrong.
A Haunting	Not Quite the Right Thing	Sometimes, victims of malevolent spirits will try to confront them with extreme aggression in an attempt to intimidate them. While this might work on living creatures, it only makes the spirits stronger since they naturally feed on all forms of negative energy, including anger.
A Haunting	Our Ghosts Are Different	In one episode, the haunting didn't come from any passed on, actually, it came from the haunted herself, where the poltergeist came from her unaddressed mental health.
A Haunting	Our Vampires Are Different	Man from "Demon Child" looks oddly vampiric with his utterly pale skin and disturbing facial features. He's apparently some sort of ghostly vampire that becomes stronger by corrupting young victims into malice. Whatever he is, it's very clear that the consequences of failing to get rid of him with this trope in mind could be dire indeed.
A Haunting	Spooky Photographs	Used to tell what is present in the house.
A Haunting	Stringy-Haired Ghost Girl	Several have been shown, usually demonic.
A Haunting	Supernatural-Proof Father	Happens a majority of the time.

A Killer Paradox	Protagonist Journey to Villain	The drama follows Lee Tang as he transforms from an ordinary college student into a Serial-Killer Killer.

A Killer Paradox	Serial-Killer Killer	Lee Tang eventually becomes this
Agent Carter	The '40s	The season is set post-WWII in 1946. The writers describe it as an ambiguous period before the Cold War officially took off.McFeely: We have a tendency to think of history as this fixed thing. "Oh, that's right. Good guys won, 1945. Then it was the 50s." It's just not the case. Everything was up for grabs for quite a while, and murky. We didn't know we really won.
Agent Carter	Acting Unnatural	
Agent Carter	Action Girl	Agent Carter, of course. From officer in the British armed forces to Agent/Co-Founder of S.H.I.E.L.D, and with impeccable sense of grace and fashion to boot.
Agent Carter	Action Heroine	Peggy Carter. Throwing punches and shooting guns are her preferred ways of beating her enemies in the course of her secret agent work.
Agent Carter	Adaptational Attractiveness	
Agent Carter	Adaptational Heroism	
Agent Carter	Adaptational Wimp	In-universe with the radio show. Peggy's character is reduced to being a Damsel in Distress nurse who keeps getting kidnapped by Nazis. She is naturally irritated.
Agent Carter	Affably Evil	Joseph Manfredi (Hydra's Blackwing, in the comics) is very chipper and personable in spite of being a murderous mobster who might beat you to death if you cross him.
Agent Carter	Affectionate Nickname	Both Colleen and Howard call Peggy "Peg." Angie calls her "English." Dum Dum suggests giving Peggy the nickname of "Miss Union Jack", but she disagrees.
Agent Carter	All Women Are Lustful	Well, maybe not all women, but some women in Griffith Hotel clearly take pride at their ability to smuggle men to their room under the landlady's nose. They even congratulate each other if they succeeded. At least three of them are shown smuggling men on-screen, with two of them being Howard Stark's brief flings (and he implied there are more).
Agent Carter	Alliterative Family	The siblings Michael and Margaret 'Peggy' Carter.
Agent Carter	Almost Dead Guy	Unfortunately Brannis's voice synthesizer is broken. So he draws a clue in the dirt next to him.
Agent Carter	Alternate Character Interpretation	Peggy observes In-Universe that the men of the SSR see her the way they want to see her and not as she actually is — Dooley saw her as "a stray kitten" left on his doorstep that needed sheltering, Thompson saw her as "a secretary turned damsel", etc. Basically, everyone saw her as this fragile English rose that needed protecting when in truth she is twice the badass they are — something Peggy ultimately ended up using to her advantage in her own quest to learn the truth about Howard Stark's alleged crimes, since, as she notes, everyone acts like she's "invisible" unless she's got (their) coffee, (their) lunch or reports (they asked for). Even Sousa, who came closest to respecting her abilities, saw her as "the girl on the pedestal", rather than an actual person. (And when he stops putting her on a pedestal she's "transformed into a daft whore").
Agent Carter	Amazon Brigade	Leviathan's Black Widow program.
Agent Carter	Anachronistic Soundtrack	The first episode opens with "That Man" by Caro Emerald. The episode is set in 1947 but the song is from 2010.
Agent Carter	And Starring	Shea Whigham (Chief Dooley) in the OBB. Dominic Cooper (Howard Stark) always gets billed under the "Special Guest Star" citation separated from the regular guest cast list every time he appears.
Agent Carter	Anyone Can Die	Peggy and Howard Stark are protected (see Doomed by Canon/Saved by Canon) because we already know their post-1946 fates. Anyone else is fair game. Examples include: Colleen, Krzemenski, Yauch, and most shockingly, Chief Dooley who's billed as a regular but dies in the penultimate episode.
Agent Carter	Apologetic Attacker	Peggy apologizes profusely before attacking Thompson in order to run away.Peggy: I'm so sorry, Jack.
Agent Carter	Arc Villain	Dr. Fennhoff for the Season 1. He masterminded the theft of Howard Stark's inventions and framed Howard for the sale of his dangerous tech on the black market as revenge because Howard invented the chemical that killed his brother.
Agent Carter	Artistic License – History	Many historical inaccuracies can be found in the show.
Agent Carter	Ascended Extra	In the comics, Peggy Carter was little more than a Satellite Love Interest to Captain America. Then she gained a major role in Captain America: The First Avenger, and now the star of her own series. Adding to that, the same could said about the one shot; it was solely created to bridge what happened to Peggy after the war, but the fanbase loved the one shot so much they wanted to see more about Peggy Carter and her involvement in the creation of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Agent Carter	As Long as It Sounds Foreign	The symbols in the book Peggy reads in Episode 3, Cryptology Semiotics, don't correspond to any real life runes. Instead they're actually fake ones made for The Mortal Instruments.
Agent Carter	Asshole Victim	In order to get a vantage point for sniping, Dottie goes to a dentist's office under the pretext of a job interview. The Dentist is a sleazy creep who seems to have been planning to persuade her to have sex with him in order to get the job and perhaps would have outright tried to assault her, given that the "interview" was being conducted in an empty office at the end of the day. Dottie was definitely planning on killing him from the outset, but his behavior may have played a role in the manner in which she killed him.
Agent Carter	Badass in a Nice Suit	
Agent Carter	Batman Gambit	Sousa's use of earplugs before fighting Fennhoff. It gives the bad doctor the impression that he can use his hypnotism, which allows Sousa to get close enough to punch him out.

Agent Carter	Been There, Shaped History	The Council of Nine in season 2 organized the Wall Street crash of 1929, triggering The Great Depression, and it's implied they're behind a lot of other historical events.
Agent Carter	Berserk Button	Manfredi will beat you to death with his bare hands if you say something even unintentionally disparaging about his true love, Whitney Frost.
Agent Carter	Big Bad	
Agent Carter	Bitch Slap	Jarvis and Peggy have to question Howard Stark's ex-girlfriends, who don't hold back at expressing their outrage over The Casanova who loved and left them. Cue Jarvis getting repeatedly slapped in the face as a handy surrogate for his boss. When Peggy intercepts one slap, he gets kicked in the shin instead. Averted when Peggy herself gets angry at Howard; she flat-out punches him.
Agent Carter	Dark Action Girl	Dottie. Unlike Peggy, an SSR agent, Dottie is a professional assassin and graduate of the Black Widow program.
Agent Carter	Darker and Edgier	
Akumaizer 3	Sequel Hook	The final episode ends with the Akumaizer 3's souls being sealed in a set of capsules and floating away, setting up the origin of the Choujins in Choujin Bibyun.
Agent Carter	Black-and-Gray Morality	Other than Carter herself, the SSR folks are by-and-large chauvinistic Inspector Javerts who will often use ethically questionable tactics when questioning witnesses; meanwhile, Howard Stark and Jarvis will often keep secrets from others, including Peggy. On the other hand, the Leviathan organization is clearly, unambiguously evil (or at least the worst possible depiction of a Soviet agency), but its leader turns out to have moralistic motives behind their murders.
Agent Carter	Black Dude Dies First	Spider Raymond is the first corpse in the pilot episode.
Agent Carter	Bond One-Liner	After Spider Raymond forcefully kisses Peggy and is knocked out instantly by her poisoned lipstick:Peggy: Well, that was a bit premature.

Agent Carter	Breakout Character	Peggy Carter. From Satellite Love Interest in the comics, to the first female lead in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Agent Carter	Brick Joke	
Agent Carter	Brief Accent Imitation	
Agent Carter	Bring the Anchor Along	In the second episode, Peggy defeats an accomplice of a Leviathan agent but knocked him out cold before he could be interrogated. She ties him to a chair and leaves, and he's found later by the SSR fleeing out in the road with the chair still tied to him. Chief Dooley, after arresting him, snarks at the guy trying to play it casual.Dooley: Yeah, I know. I used to go for walks at night with a chair strapped to my ass too.
Agent Carter	But for Me, It Was Tuesday	A heroic version: By the second season, Howard Stark can't remember who Dottie Underwood is. When Peggy and Jarvis remind him that she's the girl who kidnapped him at gunpoint, it still doesn't ring a bell.
Agent Carter	Cacophony Cover-Up	Peggy turns up her radio so that she can safely hammer a hole into the wall to hide the vial of Steve's blood.
Agent Carter	Call-Forward	
Agent Carter	Campfire Character Exploration	The fifth episode has the Howling Commandos, Peggy, and the other SSR agents hold a campfire and share war stories before their mission. Thompson, up until now depicted only as a bully, also shares the story of how he got his WWII medal, though he's not entirely truthful about it, having found out later that the enemy soldiers he had "saved" his troops from were actually surrendering.
Agent Carter	Cardboard Box of Unemployment	Invoked and then downplayed. Peggy is told to pack her things after the SSR catches wind of her vigilante investigation and fires her. However, she was given so few responsibilities from her sexist coworkers that there isn't much to pack.
Agent Carter	Cassandra Truth	Initially people don't listen to Peggy because she's a woman. Then they don't listen to her because she's been undermining the agency, conducting an independent and unauthorized investigation, for which she's been arrested. However, she does manage to convince them that she's serious when she says she spotted a mole in the organization, and go to investigate.
Agent Carter	Casting Gag	
Agent Carter	Character Death	
Agent Carter	Chekhov's Boomerang	The SSR photgraphs Peggy while she's disguised as a blonde at La Martinque, and she spends part of the second episode trying to steal the photos before learning that they're all from the back. Unfortunately, though, they still provide evidence in later episodes when Sousa is informed the woman in the photo actually has brown hair, and then sees scars on Peggy's shoulder that match those on the picture.
Agent Carter	Chekhov's Gun	
Agent Carter	Chickification	In-Universe example. In the Captain America Adventure Hour, Peggy is turned into Betty Carver, a triage nurse and generic Damsel in Distress.
Agent Carter	Children Are Innocent	Peggy is a firm believer of this, even stopping Dum Dum from killing a child with a hand grenade, even after said child is shown to be a cold-blooded assassin who killed one of the Howling Commandos and later shoots one of the SSR agents in the back. Then again, a grenade would have alerted every single guard in the base to their presence.
Agent Carter	Clear Their Name	Peggy embarks on a mission to prove Howard is not a traitor.
Agent Carter	Cloth Fu	Peggy uses a piece of white cloth when fighting against Dottie in the finale, to tangle her arms and keep her from using her knife.
Agent Carter	Combat Pragmatist	Peggy will use whatever is at hand to take down opponents, many of whom are much larger than she is. She takes down one goon with a stapler and it apparently takes a while before doctors can remove all the staples she put into the guy's face.
Agent Carter	Comic-Book Movies Don't Use Codenames	
Agent Carter	Compromising Call	While Peggy is investigating the Roxxon factory, Mr. Jarvis calls her on his walkie-talkie. This alerts the workers to her presence, which ultimately leads to a truck of Nitramine escaping and to the implosion of the factory.
Agent Carter	Continuity Nod	Has its own page.
Agent Carter	Continuity Snarl	The flashback of Agent Carter action scenes at the beginning of the first episode includes some scenes from the Agent Carter Marvel One-Shot. However, the One Shot has been said to take place after this series, which would mean its clips Peggy flashbacked to were from the future...
Agent Carter	Contrast Montage	Peggy's Morning Routine in peacetime is contrasted with her kicking ass and taking names during World War II.
Agent Carter	The Coroner Doth Protest Too Much	At the beginning of the second episode, we see an obituary stating a woman "died suddenly in her bed". Those who saw the first episode know she did die in her bed all right, and it was sudden... but it involved a bullet in the middle of her forehead.
Agent Carter	Costume Porn	40's style.Hayley Atwell: Handmade hats and buttons imported from Paris. 1946 tailored dresses and suits. So elegant.
Agent Carter	Covert Group with Mundane Front	
Agent Carter	Creator Cameo	At the end of "The Blitzkrieg Bomb", Jarvis sits down next to Howard Stark at a shoeshine booth. The person at the other end? Stan Lee.
Agent Carter	Crocodile Tears	Angie uses these on the SSR when helping Peggy escape.
Agent Carter	Curb-Stomp Battle	Dottie kills Mr. Mink by snapping his neck before he even has time to fire his gun.
Agent Carter	Cut Short	In the wake of the show's Cancellation, several plot threads are left at least partially unresolved, including who shot Jack, why, and if he survived; the full potential and implications of Zero Matter; Dottie still at large; the mystery of the Arena Club pin; if Daniel Sousa is in fact Peggy's future husband; what was in the M. Carter file (and which Carter it referred to); and perhaps most importantly of all, the actual founding of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Agent Carter	Death by Secret Identity	The guard at the Heartbreak who Agent Carter beat up is hauled away by Agent Kreminski, but just when he's about to go into detail about the dark-haired British woman who attacked him, they're both assassinated by Black Widow.
Agent Carter	Death Glare	Peggy gives a lot of these, such as her long Death Glare at the radio playing "The Captain America Adventure Hour" at the beginning of the second episode.
Agent Carter	Death Seeker	Jarvis implies that Peggy has a death wish and this is why she takes so many risks and refuses any and all effort at help or association.
Agent Carter	Deliberate Values Dissonance	While The First Avenger had some brief cases of period racism and sexism, they were generally downplayed in favor of a nostalgic past. Here, though, it's made clear that the 1940s had plenty of backwards ethics in America. This is in line with the slander Women Army Corps faced during and after World War II
Agent Carter	Desk Jockey	Samberly accuses field agents of looking down on support staff like him. They do, but he's also a bit of an obnoxious person as well.
Agent Carter	Destination Defenestration	Peggy throws Green Suit out of her apartment window when fighting him after he followed her to her apartment.
Agent Carter	Diegetic Switch	
Agent Carter	Dirty Communists	In contrast to the Nazi-born HYDRA from Captain America: The First Avenger, the villains this time around are from the Soviet Union. Though we eventually find out their motivation is less one-dimensional than typical examples of this trope.
Agent Carter	Does This Remind You of Anything?	Peggy is on the phone to Jarvis, but has to wait impatiently while he attends to something else. While she's on hold, music is playing because Jarvis has placed the telephone receiver next to the radio. Brannis was right: she's not going to like the future.
Agent Carter	Downer Ending	
Agent Carter	The Dragon	Dottie is a product of Dr. Fennhoff's Black Widow program and his chief minion.
Agent Carter	Drugged Lipstick	The "Sweet Dreams" lipstick, which causes temporary unconsciousness to anyone who's kissed by it. Peggy uses it while disguised to knock Spider Raymond, and later Dottie steals it and uses it on Peggy before attempting to kill her. Carter: (slowly passing out) "You're wearing my brand."
Agent Carter	Dude, Where's My Respect?	
Agent Carter	Embarrassing Nickname	Happy Sam Sawyer thinks that "Howling Commandos" is a pretty stupid nickname. Peggy isn't too thrilled with Dum Dum's suggestion of "Miss Union Jack", either.
Agent Carter	Enfant Terrible	
Agent Carter	Entertainingly Wrong	Between their blatant biases (such as about Stark's guilt and Peggy's competence) and just not having all the facts, the SSR often jumps to the wrong conclusions. Combined with the parts they get right and their rather effective following of the leads they do have, this winds up causing a lot of trouble for Peggy.
Agent Carter	Equal-Opportunity Evil	Isodyne Energy is a villainous organization that was nonetheless the only company to agree to hire a black physicist and a woman. It's eventually revealed that the company only employed them and other minorities because they'd be too reliant on their jobs to complain about all of the dastardly work going on there.
Agent Carter	Evil Counterpart	
Agent Carter	Exact Words	Dooley calls "everyone" to the briefing room, telling Peggy to "cover the phones." Peg promptly calls the switchboard and has all calls forwarded to the briefing room, and with the phones thus covered, heads in for the briefing.
Agent Carter	Eye Scream	
Agent Carter	Fake Guest Star	
Agent Carter	Faking the Dead	What the SSR think both Sasha Demidov and Leet Brannis did, as both were members of the Red Army who were listed as KIA during World War II in the Battle of Finow. Adding to the mystery is that Colonel Mueller said that the Nazis didn't participate in the Battle of Finow, since the Russian forces had already been massacred by the time the Germans got there.
Agent Carter	Fantastic Nuke	Nitramene, it has a blast radius of 500 yards after which it creates a vacuum that causes an implosion as matter rushes to fill the void that it has created. Zero Matter, discovered by accident in the backstory to the second season, does much the same thing except it's sucking things into an interdimensional void.
Agent Carter	Fauxshadow	The second half of the second season spends a lot of time foreshadowing the death of Jarvis thanks to his Thrill Seeker status making him throw himself into Peggy's work. Instead, the season ends with his wife, Ana, having been severely injured and no longer able to have children.
Agent Carter	Feminist Fantasy	It's the first MCU production with a female lead, and makes a point of the era's sexism. One of the commercials even advertised it as another entry in ABC's tradition of Strong Female Characters like Sidney Bristow and Olivia Pope. This is perhaps best represented by it passing just about every major test involving portraying female characters in a positive way in the first episode.
Agent Carter	Finish Him!	A woman gives a young Dottie this as a signal to snap her fellow student's neck.
Agent Carter	First Love	Whoever "the husband" turns out to be, this show makes it painfully clear that a part of Peggy's heart will always belong to Steve Rogers.
Agent Carter	Foe Romance Subtext	Over the course of the series, Dottie becomes quite obsessed with Peggy; in the season two premiere Dottie has gone so far to dye her hair brown and copy Peggy's red hat and blue jack look, she's very excited at the prospect of being interrogated by Peggy, spends the short-lived session looking at and speaking to her in a flirtatious manner, and is visibly crushed when Jack takes over.
Agent Carter	Foregone Conclusion	Thanks to Captain America: The Winter Soldier, a few fortunate and not-so-fortunate events are inevitable, including Peggy and Stark's survival past the 40s, and HYDRA infiltrating S.H.I.E.L.D. from its very inception. Stark will eventually marry a woman named Maria and father Tony, the future Iron Man, before dying along with his wife in an "automobile accident" actually set up by HYDRA. Likewise, Dr. Anton Vanko — who we meet in the first episode, as a friend of Jarvis's — will ultimately be deported by Stark after attempting to profit from one of their inventions, leading to the events of Iron Man 2 where his son Ivan will go on a Roaring Rampage of Revenge against Stark's son. And regardless of Leviathan's fate, its Black Widow program will continue for at least several more decades (and possibly even still in the present day MCU), eventually giving rise to Natasha Romanoff among its alumni.
Agent Carter	Foreshadowing	Dottie killed Mink by combining Murderous Thighs with Neck Snap and landed with a Three-Point Landing. All are Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow's favourite moves. Episode 5 confirmed her identity as the one of the first Black Widows.
Agent Carter	Freudian Trio	
Agent Carter	A Friend in Need	In "A Sin to Err", Angie keeps Peggy from being caught by the SSR. Particularly remarkable since she had no idea what was happening, just that her friend was in trouble, so she did not even hesitate to help.
Agent Carter	The Friend Nobody Likes	The SSR has two. There's Thompson, the misogynistic Number Two to the Chief, and Krzeminski, an even more misogynistic Fat Bastard adulterer that even Thompson doesn't like.
Agent Carter	General Ripper	The late General John McGinnis, whose morally heinous actions led to the main conflict of the first season.
Agent Carter	The Ghost	Jarvis' wife doesn't appear until the Season 2 premiere.
Agent Carter	Gilligan Cut	A version of it - in a flashback to Peggy's childhood, we see her mother admonishing her to behave. Cut to adult Peggy...Mrs. Carter: One of these days, you're going to have to start behaving like a lady.(cut to 1947, where Peggy is eating a sandwich in Howard's lab)Dr. Wilkes: (muttering) Four...(A glob of mayonnaise falls though Dr. Wilkes' hand and splatters onto the page)Peggy: (with her mouth full) Oh, sorry! I'm starved.
Agent Carter	Good Cop/Bad Cop	After a crooked Roxxon employee is nabbed, Agents Dooley and Thompson interrogate him and take on the respective roles. Dooley shows the crook a carrot and a stick, and offers him the lighter "carrot" deal where the crook spills the name of his boss and thus gets off easy. When the crook refuses, Dooley takes the carrot and leaves... and Thompson takes over, makes the crook bite down on the stick, and promptly starts beating him black and blue to confess, breaking the stick in half in the process. One of the other agents quips that he'd hate to see what would've happened if Dooley had left the carrot.
Agent Carter	Good Old Fisticuffs	Peggy uses straightforward punches and Improvised Weapons, in contrast to Dottie's acrobatic martial arts.
Agent Carter	Gory Discretion Shot	Thankfully, we don't see much of how the theatre full of movie-goers met their ends at each other's hands after being dosed with the "Midnight Oil" gas from Item 17. Judging by the reactions of the people who were lucky enough to arrive late to the aftermath, however, it was particularly horrific.
Agent Carter	Gretzky Has the Ball	The male agents are poring over some photographs from a nightclub and ask Carter if a man in the background of one of them is legendary baseball player Joe DiMaggio. Carter says she can't tell — she doesn't follow boxing. This ends up settling a wager over whether or not she knows anything about sports.
Agent Carter	Hate Plague	The elusive "Item 017" turns out to be canisters of gas that can cause an extreme version of this, where people kill each other in fits of homicidal rage. Once the villains get their hands on this they deploy it in a theater to test its effectiveness, as it has been in storage for a while.
Agent Carter	Have a Gay Old Time	Season 2 introduces some antiquated Forties lingo. Sousa calls Detective Henry a "homicide dick" (slang for detective) and also refers to black people as "colored", the politically-correct term for the day.
Agent Carter	Hidden Depths	Krzeminski and Thompson are both sexist Jerkasses, but Krzeminski apparently kept both a wife and girlfriend happy and Thompson is haunted by killing enemy soldiers despite being lauded for it. Depth doesn't have to make them likable.
Agent Carter	Hoist by His Own Petard	In "A Sin to Err", Peggy is taken down by a female secret agent in disguise whom she underestimated, with a kiss from her own drugged lipstick. Just like she did to a bad guy in an earlier episode.
Agent Carter	Hollywood Encryption	Peggy is able to decipher a message encrypted via a one-time pad near instantly just by deducing that the original message was in Russian. In real life, a one-time pad message is based on a random cipher and thus is mathematically impossible to decode if one doesn't have its specific cipher.note There was a historical case of the NSA cracking some one-time pads, but the VENONA project was only possible because the Soviets got sloppy and reused the same set of pads to encrypt multiple messages during WWII, and even then only succeeded in decrypting maybe 1% of all messages sent with those pads despite 40 years of cryptanalysis. And even if that message had been sent using one of the VENONA pads, it seems highly implausible that Carter had memorized the 35,000 reused one-time pads which the Soviets were rapidly phasing out of use in 1946. The cipher being there with the message is unlikely, since the guy initially hired to hack spent hours with no results trying to crack the code and presumably would have recognized a Cyrillic alphabet cipher even if he didn't understand the words.
Agent Carter	Hollywood Healing	Peggy gets impaled in "The Atomic Job". In the following episode, which starts the next day, she can barely walk. In the episode after that, which only takes place a few days later, she's perfectly fine.
Agent Carter	Hope Spot	
Agent Carter	Hypno Pendulum	Fennhoff's ring seems to serve as one. He uses it to hypnotize anyone who hears him speak to them too long.
Agent Carter	Hypocritical Humor	
Agent Carter	Idiot Ball	
Agent Carter	Improperly Placed Firearms	Carter identifies the weapon used to kill Krzeminski as a Soviet Korovin TK pistol. Dottie (who's implied to have been the assassin) only uses a Walther PPK. Though it would make sense to dispose of a weapon used to kill a US government agent.
Agent Carter	Improvised Weapon	Carter uses these a lot. At one point, Carter uses a stapler to beat up a crook. Later, she uses a suitcase to make a suspect on the run trip, and even later, she uses part of a crate to beat up a Mook.
Agent Carter	I Need a Freaking Drink	After defusing the first nitromene bomb in her bathroom, Peggy hastily grabs the bottle of whiskey she'd brought in (one of the ingredients in the neutralization formula) and pours herself a glass. Shame she never gets to drink it.
Agent Carter	Instantly Proven Wrong	After Peggy and Jarvis kidnap Mr. Hunt, a Mook who'd made an attempt on their lives, they return to the Stark estate, with Hunt in the trunk, to find Chief Sousa waiting for them. Since this was an unauthorized (and very illegal) mission, she tries to keep him from finding out, even when knocking from the inside of the trunk starts. Peggy: We...caught a possum on this property earlier this morning. Vicious little creature. Hunt: (from the trunk) Let me outta here! Peggy: Or I have a man stashed in the boot.
Agent Carter	Interrogation Montage	In "SNAFU", three SSR agents interrogate Peggy Carter separately, each using a different approach — Sousa (betrayed colleague), Thompson (Fire-Forged Friend), Dooley (Worthy Opponent). Carter's answers are cut between the three of them, but form a single dialogue.
Agent Carter	Interquel	The show takes place between Captain America: The First Avenger and (besides the rest of the movies) Captain America: The Winter Soldier. However, this is also a Prequel to the Agent Carter one-shot.
Agent Carter	Irony	
Agent Carter	Karmic Death	The Leviathan Agent "Green Suit" who killed Peggy's roommate had a love of nailing people's hands to tables with a knife; Peggy kills him by nailing his hand to a truck filled with explosives with a knife.
Agent Carter	Karma Houdini	In spite of murdering several people, Manfredi's only punishment is seeing Whitney Frost go crazy.
Agent Carter	Kicking Ass in All Her Finery	Basically all the time, save for the episode "The Iron Ceiling" when she dons combat gear, as Peggy is often wearing narrow skirts and high heels on missions, but especially in Now is Not the End, in which she fights a couple of mooks while wearing a long dress.
Agent Carter	Kung-Foley	Lampshaded with in-universe foley effects. Peggy beats up a crook while the Captain America radio show is playing, and her punches are intercut with shots of the radio show's foley artists making sound effects by hitting slabs of meat and crushing lobsters.
Agent Carter	Large Ham	Angie, natch, since she's an aspiring actress. Her hamminess comes in handy when she distracts the agents with her Crocodile Tears and helps Peggy evade the SSR.
Agent Carter	Last-Name Basis	Peggy and Jarvis always address each other as "Mr. Jarvis" and "Miss Carter." Jarvis is also on a last name basis with just about everyone. In company, he and his wife refer to each other as "Mr. Jarvis" and "Mrs. Jarvis."
Agent Carter	Le Parkour	Sousa has a You Have GOT to Be Kidding Me! expression when an agent of the Black Widow program escapes down a stairwell by leaping down the balcony rails.Sousa: She's...she's coming down the stairs and she's coming fast!
Agent Carter	Left Hanging	The show was cancelled with several plot points left unresolved:
Agent Carter	Legacy Character	
Agent Carter	Lighter and Softer	Agent Carter has its dark moments, but in general it's the most lighthearted of the MCU's TV shows. It's no coincidence that the scenery and outfits are much brighter and more colorful here than in the other shows.
Agent Carter	Literal Metaphor	A man being interrogated by the SSR is literally shown a carrot and a stick. After he refuses the plea deal, Dolley takes away the carrot.
Agent Carter	Living Out a Childhood Dream	In the Flashback Episode "Smoke & Mirrors," young Peggy Carter dreamed of adventure and saving people, but was discouraged by her mother's wanting her to be a lady. By the time she was 19, Peggy had become a code breaker engaged to a man in her office and given up her dreams. She even initially turns down the offer to join the SOE as a field agent because it wouldn't be proper for her, despite her older brother Michael's encouragement. It isn't until she gets news of Michael's death in the war that she decides to realize her dream and take the position that would lead her to become Agent Carter.
Agent Carter	The Lost Lenore	Steve is this to Peggy (even though the audience knows he's not really dead but merely frozen).
Agent Carter	MacGyvering	Jarvis tells Carter that in order to defuse a nitromene explosive, it has to be sprayed with a compound made from a variety of chemicals, but he doesn't know how she's going to find them on short notice in the middle of the night. She figures out that the chemicals are all ingredients of various things she has at home, and so is able to make the necessary compound from the contents of her makeup cabinet, some cleaning supplies, and a bottle of whiskey.
Agent Carter	Made of Explodium	Molecular Nitramine, one of Howard Stark's "bad babies" that is compared in power to the A-bomb. One grenade's worth of Nitramine (coupled with a storage of a few dozen more such grenades) is enough to blow up an entire refinery in an enormous explosion, then implode it into a ball about three feet in radius. So just think what a full-size bomb's worth would do.
Agent Carter	Madonna-Whore Complex	
Agent Carter	The Mafia	Joseph Manfredi in Los Angeles is an Italian-American mobster who cooks pasta with his mother when he's not beating people to death.
Agent Carter	Married to the Job	Peggy claims she is this when asked if she has a man.
Agent Carter	May I Borrow a Cup of Sugar?	When recommending an apartment to Peggy, Angie says she'd be right next door if she needed to borrow a cup of sugar.
Agent Carter	Meaningful Name	Punny version. In "Lady in the Lake" a woman's body is found impossibly frozen. The medical examiner assigned to the case is named "Meltzer".note Pronounced "melts 'er".
Agent Carter	The Mole	Ivchenko. He pretends to be the SSR's information source on Leviathan while secretly working for Leviathan and with Dottie.
Agent Carter	Mood Whiplash	
Agent Carter	Mook Horror Show	The fourth episode starts off in the POV of the Mooks who have Howard Stark held captive. One of their fellow Mooks is knocked out by some killer in the shadows, and when they try and find out who did this to him, they only end up being knocked out by the same killer, who, of course, is none other than Peggy. The scene is complete with spooky background music, too!
Agent Carter	Murderous Thighs	How Dottie disposes of Mr. Mink.
Agent Carter	Musical Episode	The opening of "A Little Song and Dance" lives up to its title.
Agent Carter	Mythology Gag	Has its own page.
Agent Carter	Never a Self-Made Woman	Played With. Peggy is absolutely a Self-Made Woman. The problem is, this trope is so enforced in the minds of her superiors and coworkers that they all assume she got her job with the SSR by virtue of her relationship with Captain America; their relationship never got any farther than planning a first date before Cap crashed Schmidt's plane into the ice. The truth, as Jarvis points out, is much closer to being the opposite: Cap got the opportunity to prove himself because of Peggy, and he depended on Peggy for support and guidance.
Agent Carter	Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!	
Agent Carter	No Celebrities Were Harmed	
Agent Carter	Noodle Incident	Carter apparently spent a week in New York City's sewers in 1942. She tells Jarvis she'll tell him the whole story about it some other time.
Agent Carter	No Off Button	Howard Stark invented a heated jacket for use in subzero temperatures. Unfortunately, it is powered by a chemical reaction that is very hard to stop. Even worse, once the jacket operates for a few minutes, the clasps holding it shut start fusing together which makes it impossible to remove the jacket before the reaction reaches a critical point and the entire apparatus explodes. Howard abandoned the project but kept the prototype in storage. When the bad guys steal it, they use it as a bomb.
Agent Carter	No Periods, Period	An Averted Trope in an invoked example. Knowing how sexist her coworkers are, Peggy uses "ladies' things" as an excuse to have a sick day from work. This does allow her to leave without her boss questioning what would probably be suspicious activity.
Agent Carter	No Smoking	Despite taking place in the 1940's, nobody is seen smoking.
Agent Carter	Not in Front of the Kid!	When Thompson beats up a crook for information, Dooley recommends that Peggy step out to avert her lady eyes. This word of caution hardly makes sense, considering she just saw someone shot dead two nights before, not to mention she's been in a war.
Agent Carter	The Not-Love Interest	
Agent Carter	Not What It Looks Like	Averted. After getting easily flipped by Peggy, Jarvis reverses her hand of assistance, trips her and ends up on top, only for Jarvis's wife Ana to appear. However, being Happily Married and knowing Jarvis so well, Ana immediately realises what has happened.
Agent Carter	Obfuscating Stupidity	Peggy 'accidentally' reveals that Dooley is lying about not having the missing car report that Javis filed, to stop him cracking and confessing all. This is Played for Drama because she's been trying to prove her worth, only to end up reinforcing Dooley's belief that a woman can't make a good SSR agent. Dottie Underwood plays the trope straight by acting The Ditz.
Agent Carter	Opposites Attract	When Peggy finally meets Jarvis's wife, she is surprised to find out that she is quite lively, colorful and even kind of loud, as opposed to the stiff, proper Jarvis. Regardless, they seem to be a very happy couple.
Agent Carter	Origin Story	
Agent Carter	Outrun the Fireball	Carter and Jarvis at the Roxxon refinery explosion/implosion.
Agent Carter	Outside Ride	
Agent Carter	Parenthetical Swearing	
Agent Carter	Playing Doctor	Seeking a disguise, Peggy chooses a stethoscope with Labcoat of Science and Medicine from the closet in Stark's boudoir.Peggy Carter: Oh, this could be useful... [off Jarvis' expression] Oh, don't be lewd!
Agent Carter	Platonic Life-Partners	Peggy is one of the few women Howard Stark doesn't actively hit on and their dialogue indicates that he firmly considers her to be a friend. Although she claims he tried to kiss her on V-E Day and she made their boundaries clear by throwing him into the River Thames, she told that story to Agent Sousa to convince him that Howard doesn't like boats, knowing quite well he made his getaway on a boat. Given how she clearly still feels about Steve, it's clear her willingness to risk being charged with treason to help Howard is an indication of this trope on her part, and given how Steve felt about her, we can guess Howard's intentions as well.
Agent Carter	Poison Ring	Played with and ultimately subverted. Agent Dooley goes to Nuremberg to interrogate a German officer who is facing imminent execution by hanging. He pops open his watch to reveal that it is a fake watch that holds three cyanide tablets. He offers one to the German officer, who then talks. As he's leaving, Dooley pops the watch open again in the presence of a guard and offers the guard a breath mint.
Agent Carter	Politically Incorrect Villain	The Arena Club is a racist, sexist, and classist cabal of rich white (mostly) old men. They want to recruit Howard Stark into the fold, but seeing that he's none of the three politically incorrect qualifiers (except the middle one to some degree), he knows he's an ill fit.
Agent Carter	Power Glows	All the dangerous tech stolen from Stark's vault seems to glow in one color or another. For example, the Nitramine glows orange and the Constrictor glows a bright green.
Agent Carter	Pre-Mortem One-Liner	Peggy delivers one to Green Suit just after pinning his hand down to the truck full of explosive Nitramene with a knife, and just before leaping off of the truck.Peggy: This is where I get off.
Agent Carter	Present-Day Past	The periodic table in the Los Angeles SSR office lab is very up-to-date, including atomic elements that had not even been discovered (much less named, as Copernicium, symbol Cn, wasn't named until 2009) in the 1940s setting of the series.
Agent Carter	Pretty Little Headshots	The preferred execution method used by Leviathan agents.
Agent Carter	Product Placement	In-universe, The Captain America Adventure Hour manages to squeeze a mention of the brand and model of sewing machine "Betty Carver" uses right in the middle of the action. (This was the standard method of advertising used by old-time live radio shows, as prerecorded commercials did not yet exist.)
Agent Carter	Protagonist Title	Not a hard guess who the main character is.
Agent Carter	Race Lift	Happy Sam Sawyer is African-American, in contrast to the comics, where he is a white man.
Agent Carter	Reality Is Unrealistic	The show's depiction of sexism seems over-the-top by today's standards, but Agent Carter takes place well before the women's liberation movement and at a time when traditionalist attitudes toward a woman's "place" actually were that common. As happened to Colleen in the first episode, the prevailing attitude was that the ladies did their part while the men were at war, but once the war was over, they were expected to go back to their proper "sphere" as wives and mothers, as though the war never happened. And most women Peggy's age, if they weren't stay-at-home wives and mothers, were either secretaries, teachers, waitresses or nurses.
Agent Carter	"The Reason You Suck" Speech	
Agent Carter	Remember the New Guy?	
Agent Carter	Replaced with Replica	Peggy Carter is told by Stark to steal a superweapon called "The Blitzkrieg Button" from a lab and replace it with a fake, before the scientists examining it activate it by accident. However, it turns out the real one was not a weapon either, but a container for something more valuable that Stark wants back without anyone knowing: the last sample of Steve Rogers' blood.
Agent Carter	Returning the Wedding Ring	In an episode that has flashbacks of Peggy's younger years in England, she was engaged to be married, turning down an opportunity to take work in the field undercover, which her brother had recommended her for. After word comes that her brother has been killed in action, she packs her bags and leaves, taking the letter offering the position and leaving her engagement ring in its place.
Agent Carter	Rogues' Gallery Transplant	As Peggy doesn't have much of a Rogues Gallery in the comics, most of non-Canon Foreigner villains are from other Marvel franchises.
Agent Carter	Rule of Three	Peggy and Jarvis confront three of Howard's exes in "A Sin to Err." The first two slap Jarvis; the third is blocked by Peggy so she kicks Jarvis in the shins instead.
Agent Carter	Running Gag	
Agent Carter	Sacrificial Lamb	Peggy's first roommate is killed in just her second scene to demonstrate how ruthless Leviathan agents are.
Agent Carter	Sacrificial Lion	Agent Krzeminski bites it after only three episodes, followed by Chief Dooley in the penultimate episode.
Agent Carter	Schmuck Bait	Invoked by Jarvis when he has to get rid of a car. He leaves it somewhere in Hoboken with the keys in the ignition, counting on someone to come by and steal it.
Akumaizer 3	Shout-Out	Received a reference in Lucky Star, where its opening theme was sung by Konata Izumi as the second ending theme.
Agent Carter	Second Love	One thread running through the series is Peggy's slow movement towards finding this after Steve's death in Captain America: The First Avenger. She spends much of Season 1 learning to let go of him, and Season 2 places a few love interests in her way. Turns out her second love is Daniel Sousa.
Agent Carter	Self-Made Man	Howard claims his parents were working class people from the Lower East Side of NYC, so he had to fight his way to the top and his millions.
Agent Carter	She-Fu	
Agent Carter	Shout-Out	
Agent Carter	Shown Their Work	
Agent Carter	Show Within a Show	An in-universe Captain America pulp radio show is popular at the time of the series, and Peggy runs into it people listening to it a few times. It's about as cheesy as radio dramas got back then, and features a heavily insulting version of Peggy herself (named "Betty Carver") as a helpless Damsel in Distress who never shuts up about how manly Captain America is. Peggy can be seen giving a radio playing it an intense Death Glare at the start of the second episode.
Agent Carter	Signature Headgear	
Agent Carter	Signature Move	Dottie pretending to surrender and then roundhouse-kicking someone's gun away.
Agent Carter	Single-Issue Landlord	Miriam is obsessed about protecting the virtue of her tenants, and will not shut up about her no-men rule, the importance of her keeping it, and all the ways that various former tenants of hers have tried and failed to break it.
Agent Carter	Slut-Shaming	
Agent Carter	Snark-to-Snark Combat	
Agent Carter	Soft Glass	Averted in "SNAFU". When Dooley performs his Heroic Sacrifice while wearing the vest that is about to explode, he uses a borrowed gun to shoot out the office window to allow him to jump through them, exploding in the street.
Agent Carter	Soundtrack Dissonance	In "A Sin to Err," Peggy beats up the SSR agents sent to isolate her in the automat while the very upbeat "It's a Good Day" plays in the background.
Agent Carter	Spanner in the Works	Leviathan’s plan to steal all the dangerous tech in Stark’s vault would’ve worked flawlessly if Leet Brannis hadn’t decided to keep it all for himself and sell it to the highest bidder.
Agent Carter	The Speechless	Leviathan agents get their voice boxes surgically cut out. This was to counteract the suffocation effect of the "Midnight Oil" gas released when they were in the Battle of Finow.
Agent Carter	Speed Sex	Peggy seems quite fond of puns based on this topic.Jarvis: [Sighs] I—it's just that with Mr. Stark's tendency to, um...Peggy: Prematurely evacuate?
Agent Carter	Splash of Color	In the pilot episode, Peggy wears a bright blue jacket and a bright red hat while most of the men wear dull colored suits. According to costume designer Giovanna Ottobre-Melton, this was very deliberate: Her trademark look is the red custom ladies Stetson Stratoliner hat, a burst of color in a sea of grey fedoras. Working in man’s world she needed to stand out, and she did that using color in her wardrobe.
Agent Carter	Squick	In-universe, Peggy's male colleagues react with horror to mention of "ladies' matters," a fact she exploits to keep them from asking too many questions about why she's requested a sick day.
Agent Carter	Starter Villain	Leet Brannis and Green Suit compete for the role of antagonist in the first 2 episodes. They both die in the climax of Episode 2, leading to Dottie Underwood and Dr. Fennhoff becoming the true big bads of the season.
Agent Carter	Stealth Pun	Beginning in Season 2, when Sousa was promoted from the SSR's New York office to the chief of the Los Angeles bureau, he kept a Brooklyn Dodgers cap in his office. The Dodgers themselves would move to Los Angeles prior to the 1958 Major League Baseball season.
Agent Carter	Stiff Upper Lip	Peggy and Jarvis can maintain a high level of politeness even when they are about to be blown up.
Agent Carter	The Stinger	In the season 1 finale stinger, we find out that Dr. Fennhoff's cellmate is Arnim Zola, Red Skull's HYDRA scientist from World War II and the one who got the organization into S.H.I.E.L.D.
Agent Carter	Stock Footage	The first episode includes footage from Captain America: The First Avenger, as Peggy remembers her last conversation with Steve Rogers.
Agent Carter	Stock Schtick	Lampshaded by Sousa. "So I walk into this diner...this isn't a joke..."
Agent Carter	Straw Misogynist	
Agent Carter	Strictly Formula	Averted. Unlike Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., which initially relied on the Monster of the Week formula, Agent Carter avoids a weekly routine in favor of constantly changing the status quo. At first the show appeared to be going in the direction of "Howard Stark's deadly invention of the week", but then it resolved the weapons subplot in the third episode to focus more on the pursuit of Leviathan itself.Fazekas: One of the things I believe came from ABC was they didn’t want an episodic show, they didn’t want it to be Gadget of the Week or Bad Guy of the Week, which is such a nice change from five years ago. I think that because of the influence of cable and DVR and binge-watching, they’re not afraid of continuing storylines.
Agent Carter	Stuff Blowing Up	Thanks to Howard's Stark's stolen invention Nitramine, best described as a hand grenade nuke. A single one blows up an entire Roxxon refinery and a truck full of one later blows all the water out of a lake.Howard Stark: [One handful] would level a city block. I'm not talking the short ones. Avenues.
Agent Carter	Stylistic Suck	The Captain America Adventure Hour radio serial is so over the top and ridiculous it comes across as comical with its cheesy melodrama and exaggerated portrayal of "Betty Carver" as a hapless Damsel in Distress.
Agent Carter	Subliminal Seduction	The "Black Widow" trainees are shown learning to speak English from watching Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. When Peggy Carter finds the training room, she runs a few frames through the projector and finds the words INSTILL FEAR.
Agent Carter	"Success Through Sex" Accusation	Peggy is mocked for being Captain America's "liaison" even though they were barely planning their first date when he "died", and some of her coworkers are convinced that she was sleeping around with other men for her position. Worth noting here that Peggy was in a position of authority with the SSR before Steve finally got himself enlisted (she was his instructor in Basic Training), and there's absolutely no evidence she got there through any means other than her own merit. The men of the SSR simply can't imagine any way for a woman to succeed unless it's on a man's coattails.
Agent Carter	Sunshine Noir	Season 2 has Peggy Carter go to Los Angeles, where it's way sunnier than in New York City but where dark threats loom all the same.
Agent Carter	Tastes Like Friendship	Subverted with Dottie Underwood. In a flashback to her childhood in the Black Widow program, she shares some bread with a fellow inmate in their Orphanage of Fear, only to Neck Snap her during training.
Agent Carter	Team Power Walk	in "The Atomic Job" to the tune of "Pistol Packin' Mama". It's all very heroic until Jarvis brushes some lint from his lapel, Samberly stumbles, and Peggy asks where the car is, to which Jarvis apologizes and runs off to get it while the others stand around and look variously pained. Jarvis: Oh! Sorry. I had to park around the corner — street cleaning. Back in a jiffy.
Agent Carter	There Is No Kill Like Overkill	Peggy apparently believes that using a hand grenade to kill a ten-year old girl is overkill, but Dugan clearly disagrees.
Agent Carter	Title Drop	One that was used quite a bit in in the advertising. Hugh Jones: What's your name, darling?Peggy: Agent.
Agent Carter	Tim Taylor Technology	A recurring design flaw in all the dangerous tech Howard kept in his secret vault was being ridiculously overpowered for its intended purpose, becoming dangerously unstable as a result. The Nitramine, the Constrictor and the Heating Vest all qualify.
Agent Carter	Tyke-Bomb	We are introduced to a Soviet program to create these in "The Iron Ceiling". Dottie is a graduate.
Agent Carter	Took a Level in Jerkass	Howard tells Peggy that one of his confiscated weapons could black out a city for years, and only he can disarm it. It's actually a vial of Steve's blood (the last in existence) disguised in a sphere. Peggy is furious when she finds out Howard lied to her.
Agent Carter	Tragic Intangibility	In Season 2, Jason Wilkes is rendered both intangible and invisible by a Zero Matter explosion early on. While Howard Stark creates a spray that can make him visible in short bursts, any time else he literally cannot even speak due to having intangible vocal chords. He spends much of his arc trying to figure out if and how he can get back to normal and be with Peggy.
Agent Carter	Tragic Keepsake	Played for Drama with the vial of Steve Roger's blood; it has great potential scientific benefit, yet Peggy is understandably reluctant to hand it over so Howard Stark can exploit it for profit.
Agent Carter	Uncertain Doom	In the Season 2 finale, Jack Thompson is shot in the chest. With the show's cancellation, we may never know if he survived or not.
Agent Carter	Underestimating Badassery	Peggy's coworkers and superiors are all genuinely convinced that behind her bluster she's just another fragile English Rose who needs to be protected because she hasn't "grown up" and "learned her place" as a woman. As Peggy points out in the penultimate episode everyone ignores her unless she has coffee or reports because they all think of her as a "stray kitten" in need of shelter or a "secretary turned damsel" in need of protection. Thompson himself only realizes that Peggy is quite the badass when he finally sees her pick up a machine gun and start shooting people alongside her war buddies the Howling Commandos.
Agent Carter	Uptown Girl	A platonic variant. Angie briefly freezes out Peggy when the latter turns down her invitation to move in next to her, and then climbs into an expensive car driven by Jarvis, assuming she's motivated by snobbery.
Agent Carter	Vagueness Is Coming	In the first episode, the Nebulous Evil Organisation is introduced in suitably ominous terms.Leet Brannis: Leviathan is coming.Peggy Carter: Who?Leet Brannis: They'll tell you themselves soon enough. You're not going to like the future; such as it is.
Agent Carter	Waif-Fu	
Agent Carter	Wham Episode	
Agent Carter	Wham Shot	Dr. Arnim Zola, former minion to the Red Skull and future founder of the new HYDRA, showing up in Dr. Fennhoff's prison cell in the season 1 finale.
Agent Carter	What the Hell, Hero?	Pretty much everyone calls Peggy out on breaking Dottie Underwood out of prison in "Life of the Party". Herself included.
Agent Carter	Where Does He Get All Those Wonderful Toys?	Peggy has a variety of spy gadgets to help her, such as a lockpick watch or tranquilizer lipstick. In Season 2 it is revealed that at least some of them are the work of Dr. Samberly, the SSR's resident Gadgeteer Genius, although that still doesn't account for the provenance of all her toys.
Agent Carter	Wig, Dress, Accent	Peggy's disguise to infiltrate the club in the pilot is this: blonde wig, silver dress, American accent. Her disguise to infiltrate the dairy factory and check for a truck full of explosives consists of a change of hairstyle, a white labcoat from Howard Stark's closet, and a Noo Yawk accent.
Agent Carter	Women Are Delicate	
Agent Carter	World of Snark	Practically everyone has some sarcasm to deliver. There's Peggy, who turned up her snark after The First Avenger, Jarvis, Angie, Howard, Sousa...
Agent Carter	Wounded Gazelle Gambit	Dottie delivers one to the SSR just after giving a Kiss of Death to Peggy.
Agent Carter	Wunza Plot	She's a badass secret agent and WWII veteran. He's a domestic butler. Together they clear Howard Stark's name and fight Leviathan!
Agent Carter	You, Get Me Coffee	Most of the SSR thinks Peggy is only good for getting them coffee, and reports.
Agent Carter	You Talk Too Much!	Implied when Dooley finally gives Peggy an assignment and her response is Stunned Silence.Dooley: Well look at that. You really can keep your mouth shut when you try.
Akumu Chan	The Blank	Ayami has a dream where one of her students is completely face-less. To remedy this, one of the other students attempts to draw a face on him so that he can be "normal".
Akumu Chan	Dream Sequence	For a show based around dreams, this is an obvious one.
Akumu Chan	Dreaming of Things to Come	Yuiko's dreams are prophetic.
Akumu Chan	Prince Charming	The "Dream Prince" is a deliberate example of this trope. He is handsome, charming, rides a horse, and seems to exist for the sole purpose of rescuing Ayami from her troubled dreams and wooing her.
Akumaizer 3	Xavitan	A skilled fencer who was born to a human mother and demon father. As a result, when the Akuma Clan begins their attacks, Xavitan defects from them to protect humanity.
Akumaizer 3	Evil	A proficient sharpshooter. He was originally one of two demons sent after Xavitan by the Akuma Clan, but after Xavitan saved him from being crushed by a boulder he defected to join his side.
Akumaizer 3	Gabra	A stocky water demon who wields an Epic Flail in combat. He was the other demon sent after Xavitan, but joined his side after Xavitan spared his life after defeating him.
Akumaizer 3	Alas, Poor Villain	Majoruka, sister of Darunia, who was only working for Mezalord because he planted circuits in both her and Darunia's heads which would torture the other sister if one of them did anything to defy him. When she's fatally wounded in battle, Majorka allows herself to die so Darunia can go help the Akumaizer 3.
Akumaizer 3	Squashed Flat	Happens to Gabra in #24 when Yuki-onna transforms into a snowball and rolls over him, leaving him flattened. Luckily he's very quickly re-inflated by Evil.
Akumaizer 3	Amanojaku	In Episode 20 of Choujin Bibyun, a group of young youkai fans perform a ritual to summon one from the Youkai Daihyakka. What they get is Amanojaki, a bunch of floating skulls. Amanojaki proceeds to attach skulls to the heads of the children to turn them into minions, but the children inherit Amanojaki's contrariness and do not obey properly. Once Bibyun shows up, Amanojaki generates a humanoid purple body covered in swirls to do battle. It is defeated when it throws its weapon at Bibyun, and Bibyun swings his sky sword to flip Amanojaki's weapon right back at it.
Akumaizer 3	Big Badass Battle Sequence	Happens in #37 where The Akumaizer 3 and Peace Party Four People battle Mezalord and the horde of Mooks he's assembled.
Akumaizer 3	Big Bad	Mezalord, ruler of the Akuma Clan.
Akumaizer 3	Big Damn Heroes	Darunia shows up in several episodes to save the Akumaizer 3 from whatever dirty tactic the Demon of the Week is using.
Akumaizer 3	Bittersweet Ending	Akumaizer 3 definitely has a more depressing ending than the other Toku series of the time.  The Akuma Clan are reformed and make peace with humanity, and Mezalord and Geberu defeated, but the Peace Party are all dead (except for Noppelar Jr.) and the Akumaizer 3 also effectively die after sacrificing their bodies to kill Geberu. And the real mastermind is still out there...
Akumaizer 3	Black-and-White Morality	Zig-Zagged. While it's not humans = good, demons = bad, most of the demons in the show are either selfless heroes or puppy-kicking villains.
Akumaizer 3	Cool Airship	The Akumaizer 3's Zaidabeck, which resembles a robot angler fish decked out in the American Flag colors.
Akumaizer 3	Cool Bike	The Akumaizer 3's Gallivers, which combine together to form the Garibard.
Akumaizer 3	Cool Sword	The Akumaizer 3 all wield rapiers, as do many of the villains they fight.
Akumaizer 3	Dark Is Not Evil	The main trio are all demons, with one even being named "Evil". Yet they're all heroes fighting to defend humanity.
Akumaizer 3	Defeat Means Friendship	Evil and Gabra both joined Xavitan after he defeated them but spared their lives.
Akumaizer 3	Ear Worm	Both the opening and ending themes of the series are extremely catchy.
Akumaizer 3	Evil Former Friend	Several of Demons of the Week the Akumaizer 3 encounter are their former loved ones from Downworld. One episode even had Evil's girlfriend as the villain.
Akumaizer 3	Expressive Mask	The helmets worn by Xavitan and Evil occasionally change expression to show how they are feeling, such as looking more determined when they're in battle.
Akumaizer 3	Fantastic Racism	A recurring theme in early episodes is the Akumaizer 3 having to deal with prejudice from humans due to their demonic appearances.
Akumaizer 3	Fast-Forward Gag	In #20, Dracuda sends his henchmen to kidnap a boy named Taro, but the Darunia and the Akumaizer 3 to keep tricking them by using magic to disguise logs of wood as Taro, with things speeding up each time they steal a fake log and Dracuda gets more and more exasperated.
Akumaizer 3	Friend to All Children	Gabra, who even calls himself a "friend to children".
Akumaizer 3	Heel–Face Turn	Evil and Gabra start off the first episode as part of the Akuma Clan, but turn good after Xavitan defeats and spares them. Later on, four Monsters of the Week the Akumaizer encountered turn good as well and form the "Demon Peace Party".
Akumaizer 3	Heel–Race Turn	The end result of the Akumaizer 3's efforts to make peace between humans and demons is the Peace Party taking power in Downworld and ending their war against humankind, leaving Mezalord and Geberu as the only evil demons left.
Akumaizer 3	Horns of Villainy	Whereas the Akumaizer 3 lack horns despite being demons, most of the villainous demon captains in the Akuma Clan have them atop their head as a sign of rank.
Akumaizer 3	I Have Your Wife	In the second episode, Mezalord reveals to Xavitan that his human mother is still alive and in the custody of the Akuma Clan, and threatens to kill her unless Xavitan rejoins the Akuma Clan. Xavitan chooses to keep fighting, after his mother encourages him and says she would rather die than see her son give up.
Akumaizer 3	If It Swims, It Flies	Done twofold with the Cool Airship, which starts out as a typical Flying Dutchman ship (which flies), but later gets remodelled into the Zaiderbeck, looking for all the world like a giant metal angler fish (which still flies).
Akumaizer 3	Inconsistent Spelling	If one goes with the literal pronunciation of the Akumaizer's names rather than how they are commonly romanized, then they can alternatively be spelled "Zabitan", "Ibiru" and "Gabura" instead of "Xavitan", "Evil" and "Gabra".
Akumaizer 3	Killed to Uphold the Masquerade	After Xavitan frees the humans the Akuma Clan kidnapped and brought to their lair in the first episode, the Akuma Clan goes on a killing spree of them in order to prevent the secrets of the Akuma Clan from spilling out.
Akumaizer 3	Lighter and Softer	The show become a lot lighter midway through, with more light-hearted and less serious plotlines for each episode, more comedic moments and Gabra turning into an ostrich. At least until the final two episodes...
Akumaizer 3	Minion with an F in Evil	Noppelar in #24 is sent to dig up a Downworld water vein near a village in order to flood the surface, but ends up getting distracted playing with his son and helping the villagers with their water shortage instead. He unsurprisingly turns good by the end of the episode.
Akumaizer 3	Momma's Boy	Xavitan really loves his human mom. So much so that the thought of her in danger is the one thing that makes Xavitan hesitate in his quest.
Akumaizer 3	Monster of the Week	Each episode features a different demon of the Akuma Clan sent out to either take down the Akumaizer 3 or terrorize humans on the surface.
Akumaizer 3	Not Quite Dead	The heroes think they've killed Mezalord at several points in the show, but he always comes back. It later turns out this is because he has Resurrective Immortality.
Akumaizer 3	Our Demons Are Different	In this case, they're a civilization of magic-wielders who converted themselves into monstrous Cyborgs in order to live underground.
Akumaizer 3	Power Trio	The Akumaizer 3, obviously.
Akumaizer 3	The Remnant	Mezalord and Geberu become this at the end of the series, in an ironic reversal of the Akumaizer 3's position at the start of the series. After the Akuma Clan reforms offscreen, their forces become the only members of the pro-war side still active.
Akumaizer 3	Sentai	With their group poses and team Finishing Move, they definitely appear to be a partial attempt by Toei to make another Himitsu Sentai Gorenger. This means they share more elements specifically in common with Gorenger than the Sentai genre as a whole, such as using an airship as a base and riding motorcycles that combine into one.
Akumaizer 3	Surprisingly Realistic Outcome	The conflict between humans and the Akuma Clan isn't ended with some big Final Battle, but the Akuma Clan reforming internally. While the Akumaizer 3 are on the surface fighting Mezalord's forces, the Peace Party wins popular support in Downworld and pushes out the warmongering faction from power, reforming the Akuma Clan and making peace with humanity. This doesn't do away with Mezalord or Geberu however, and the Akumaizer 3 still have to fight one last battle against them.
Akumaizer 3	Token Heroic Orc	The Akumaizer 3 are the only heroic members of the Akuma Clan at first, but as the series goes on their they're joined by more and more like-minded demons, including Darunia and the Demon Peace Party.
Akumaizer 3	True Companions	The Akumaizer 3, much like their inspiration. They always have each other's back and rely on each other to watch out for their weaknesses.
Akumaizer 3	Weaksauce Weakness	Each of the Akumaizer 3 has one.
Akumaizer 3	Would Hurt a Child	The members of the Akuma Clan have no compunction with hurting or even killing children should the situation call for it. Hell, some of their plans even involve putting children in harms way. The shot where a demon impaled a child with a spear is currently a page image for this trope on Live-Action TV
Aguila Roja	Aborted Arc	Actually several, but most blatantly the Gordillo family arc at the last season. It genuinely appears to have been originally written for a longer season, as both their characters and their interactions with Lucrecia were fleshed out week after week only for the arc to end (with the series's finale) without even an onscreen conclusion.
Aguila Roja	Actor Allusion	
Aguila Roja	Age Lift	Downplayed. King Philip IV is portrayed as an elderly gentleman whose actor, Xabier Elorriaga, was in his sixties at the time of the series. However, in real life Philip died exactly at 60, despite the series is not set at the end of his reign, and never looked as old as Elorriaga does.
Aguila Roja	An Arm and a Leg	Downplayed. Águila's katana cuts limbs like a hot knife through butter, and it does cripple some mook from time to time, but it much rarer than what you would expect.
Aguila Roja	All Men Are Perverts	Many times, given that it's a Spanish production.
Aguila Roja	All Monks Know Kung-Fu	Agustín fits, presumably because he trained in Asia like Gonzalo. Also, one episode features some infanticide monks who fight with Daggers Akimbo.
Aguila Roja	All Take and No Give	Hernán and Lucrecia's relationship certainly fits the trope, with Hernán being the Giver and Lucrecia the Taker.
Aguila Roja	Amicable Exes	Gonzalo and Margarita, Hernán and Lucrecia, Gonzalo and Lucrecia and Sátur and Estuarda (well, this last one not so much).
Aguila Roja	Anachronism Stew	
Aguila Roja	Anti-Villain	Hernán and Lucrecia (both of them Type I/Type II/Type III)
Aguila Roja	Anyone Can Die	The number of people killed off in the series is surprisingly high and includes several children, not to count the sheer amount of mooks who are routinely dispatched by Águila.
Aguila Roja	Arch-Enemy	Hernán is this for Gonzalo/Águila Roja until he finds out that Hernán is his brother in the Season 1 finale. They are still pretty much enemies in the next seasons, but after The Reveal, Gonzalo starts to care for him and will go to any length to save his life.
Aguila Roja	Armoured Closet Gay	
Aguila Roja	Aristocrats Are Evil	Played many times, to the extent that Juan is the only unambiguous exception.
Aguila Roja	Artistic License – Biology	Sátur's horribly broken leg would take much more than two weeks for him to walk again. In fact, at the time a wound like that would have left him limping for the rest of his life, if he was lucky enough not to die due to a probable septicemia. There are lots of other examples of this throughout the show.
Aguila Roja	Artistic License – Geography	The city in which the series takes place seems to be placed near Madrid (or possibly to be Madrid), but it's usual for the characters to travel to remote regions of Spain in less of a day. In real life, not even changing horses from post to post would allow them to travel so freaking fast.
Aguila Roja	Artistic License – History	
Aguila Roja	Artistic License – Martial Arts	
Aguila Roja	Artistic License – Space	Two nights before a solar eclipse there's a full moon. Even Satur says "it's almost full moon", implying it has something to do with the approaching eclipse, which does not: there should be a new moon in the sky.
Aguila Roja	Asshole Victim	Considering that the series seems to be set in a World of Jerk, there is a good possibility of this trope to happen whenever someone dies.
Aguila Roja	A Taste of the Lash	Cardinal Mendoza of all people is shown self-flagelating after ordering the Successor to be killed. It's truly an interesting moment because he had never been shown to give a crap about God or religion itself aside from his aspirations to be Pope.
Aguila Roja	Aw, Look! They Really Do Love Each Other	Hernán and Lucrecia get these kind of moments from time to time. Also, Irene and Nuño.
Aguila Roja	Ax-Crazy	Hernán has his moments pre-Character Development. Some other Monster of the Week characters qualify, however.
Aguila Roja	Badass Bystander	
Aguila Roja	Badass Normal	Gonzalo has no superpowers to speak of, although his frequent Bullet Time and breaking of the Laws of Physics certainly give the impression.
Aguila Roja	Badass Teacher	Gonzalo.
Aguila Roja	Bad Habits	Mateo from the movie. He spends most of the film pretending to be a priest, but he is actually a baker who slept with the wife of his village's mayor and was forced to fly away wearing an old cassock he found in a church.
Aguila Roja	Back from the Dead	Laura, Gonzalo and Hernán's mother, though she is killed shortly after.
Aguila Roja	Batman Gambit	Sebastián Ventura plays a brilliant one with Gonzalo in order to escape unharmed and knowing his true face. He talks with a tied Águila about how he has no qualms about killing people who has helped him, and when Gonzalo claims not to be an Ungrateful Bastard like him, Ventura simply unties him and allows him to go, just moments before Sátur has him on gunpoint. The business is that if Águila had attacked him at regaining his freedom, he would have been exactly like him.
Aguila Roja	Bed Trick	Malasangre plays sneaks into Lucrecia's bedroom, blindfolds her pretending to be Hernán playing some funny foreplay and then sleeps with her. Her face when she removes the blindfold after the act and realizes who her lover actually is is priceless. (Never mind the rather improbable fact that she never noticed during sex that he was definitely not Hernán.)
Aguila Roja	Belligerent Sexual Tension	Hernán and Lucrecia. Although they will never admit it.
Aguila Roja	Beware the Nice Ones	Sátur gets some impressive moments when things break the camel's back for him. In one of them, he attacks Nuño for endangering Alonso and they trash a hall in their brawl despite him being obviously holding back. In another one, he knocks out the impostor Bernardo with a stone after the latter steals his horse.
Aguila Roja	Big Bad	
Aguila Roja	Big Brother Instinct	As shown in the flashbacks, Hernán was very protective of Gonzalo as kids, and he becomes protective of him again as soon as he finds out that Gonzalo is his brother.
Aguila Roja	Big, Screwed-Up Family	Gonzalo and Hernán's family.
Aguila Roja	Blow Gun	Eva's Moor bodyguard uses a blow gun powerful enough to punch through Gonzalo's Plot Armor. Malasangre also uses an Amazonian indigenous one to take down two chasers.
Aguila Roja	Book Worm	As a teacher, Gonzalo is incredibly knowledgeable and book smart. Agustín also fits the trope.
Aguila Roja	Break the Cutie	Margarita, Alonso, Cipri, Irene, among others.
Aguila Roja	Break the Haughty	Lucrecia. So much. Also Hernán, initially to a lesser degree, but by the end of the eighth season just on par with Lucrecia.
Aguila Roja	Brother–Sister Incest	Hernán and Irene, although it bizarrely looks like the producers forgot about it for several seasons.
Aguila Roja	Bumbling Sidekick	Sátur is this to Gonzalo/Águila Roja.
Aguila Roja	Buried Alive	Alonso gets buried alive twice in the series.
Aguila Roja	Calling Card	At the earlier seasons, Águila would leave a red feather at the scene of his attacks. Even although he mostly dropped the trait, it still comes back from time to time in the series.
Aguila Roja	Cain and Abel	Hernán and Gonzalo.
Aguila Roja	The Cameo	Motorbike racer Jorge Lorenzo appears in one episode as a famous donkey racer.
Aguila Roja	Cane Fu	The ringmaster of the freak show caravan uses some incredibly good stickfighting against Águila, countering his katana with a regular cane and even disarming him once with it.
Aguila Roja	Cannon Fodder	Hernán's guard must have some good reserves, as at least five of them are killed by Águila per episode.
Aguila Roja	The Caretaker	Agustín, towards Gonzalo and Hernán.
Aguila Roja	Chain Pain	In one episode Águila uses a chain as an improvised weapon, showing some solid kusari-fundo-jutsu skills in the process.
Aguila Roja	Character Development	Happens to most of the main characters over the course of the series, mostly from late Season 2-Season 3 onwards.
Aguila Roja	Characterization Marches On	
Aguila Roja	Chaste Hero	Gonzalo is thoroughly uninterested in sex, so much that his brief romance with Eva leaves Sátur bewildered (and overjoyed). Evidently, Margarita is Gonzalo's only exception.
Aguila Roja	Chronic Hero Syndrome	Gonzalo, naturally.
Aguila Roja	Clark Kenting	In contrast with Águila's elaborate costume, Sátur "disguises" himself with a simple hood that clearly reveals his face. He wisely avoids exposing himself when they go out, but he is still sometimes seen by people who should recognize him later.
Aguila Roja	Cold-Blooded Torture	Many times. Characters actually *die* from it.
Aguila Roja	Coincidence Magnet	Many characters are this, especially Sátur. Tons of coincidences happen throughout the series, both positive and negative, to the extent that it seems to have become a Running Gag.
Aguila Roja	Cool Old Guy	
Aguila Roja	Combat Parkour	Used by Gonzalo/Águila several times. Even Sátur, as mentioned above, shows some in the Pilot.
Aguila Roja	The Conspiracy	The Lodge.
Aguila Roja	Contrived Coincidence	Many contrived and ridiculous coincidences happen over the course of the show. There's at least one per episode.
Aguila Roja	Corrupt Church	Again, it's a post-Transition Spanish series, so nobody should expect the Church to be portrayed positively.
Aguila Roja	Crapsack World	In the series's setting, if a character has no name, then he is a raging Jerkass and/or probably a criminal.
Aguila Roja	Crazy Jealous Guy	Hernán can definitely be this way sometimes with regards to Lucrecia.
Aguila Roja	Cossacks	The movie features a Cossack assassin who proves to be a tough opponent for Águila. Oddly enough, although he is on-screen referred as a Cossack, he looks more like a Mongol.
Aguila Roja	The Cynic	Cipri, and he really has reasons.
Aguila Roja	Damsel in Distress	Margarita, Lucrecia, Alonso and Nuño often fill this role, which results in Gonzalo and Hernán having to rescue them every time they get in trouble.
Aguila Roja	Dark Action Girl	Sung-Yi.
Aguila Roja	Dark and Troubled Past	Many characters that appear on this show suffer from this, and among the main ones, Gonzalo, Hernán, Sátur and Lucrecia all have very tragic pasts.
Aguila Roja	Dark Is Evil	Hernán/The Sheriff always dresses in black. Justified, as it appears to be his guard's uniform.
Aguila Roja	Darker and Edgier	The show was already quite dramatic in the first season, but things just go downhill in later seasons, sometimes almost plunging into Black Comedy.
Aguila Roja	Death by Origin Story	Gonzalo's wife dies in the Pilot. This is Gonzalo's main motivation to become Águila Roja and is what starts the plot of the show.
Aguila Roja	Death Is Dramatic	
Aguila Roja	Death of a Child	The show always had been open about showing child characters being killed here and there, but an episode from the seventh season plays it in a HORRIFYING way.
Aguila Roja	Depraved Dwarf	The midget jester from Season 6 averts this, being just a relatively annoying character. Then played straight when he turns to be a spy for the King in charge to abduct Lucrecia's baby and presumably have him killed.
Aguila Roja	Despair Event Horizon	All the main characters get to this point eventually AND repeatedly over the seasons.
Aguila Roja	Deus Angst Machina	All the main characters are this to a high degree, but especially Cipri and Lucrecia. Gonzalo and Hernán are not far behind.
Aguila Roja	Devoted to You	Sátur and Hernán are always the two most prominent examples of devotion and loyalty; Sátur towards Gonzalo and Hernán towards Lucrecia.
Aguila Roja	Dodge the Bullet	Constantly, and sometimes even with Matrix-esque effects.
Aguila Roja	Don't You Dare Pity Me!	Hernán and Lucrecia are prone to this.
Aguila Roja	The Dragon	Pedro towards Hernán.
Aguila Roja	Katanas Are Just Better	To the point Gonzalo once pierces effortlessly a tree with his katana.
Aguila Roja	Driven to Suicide	An incredibly high number of characters have either attempted or committed suicide at some point in the series, including nearly all the main characters: Gonzalo, Hernán, Lucrecia, Irene, Gabi, Nuño, Cipri, Juan, Sátur, Margarita, etc. Some of them have attempted more than once. In Lucrecia's case, it's more like 4-5 further attempts at least by the seventh season.
Aguila Roja	Dysfunction Junction	Probably not intended by the producers at first, but after so much drama and conflict poured into the script season after season, it became a fact. If you want to cry a lot or feel miserable, don't look any further, this is the show you're looking for.
Aguila Roja	Elite Mooks	The French troopers from the film. They wear black armors and wield hand crossbows, and are clearly better trained than most of the mooks in the series.
Aguila Roja	Enfant Terrible	Blanca, Lucrecia's psychopathic goddaughter. Even the marchioness lampshades it when she wonders how a ten years old can have such a penchant for killing.
Aguila Roja	Everyone Calls Him "Barkeep"	Hernán is much better known as simply The Sheriff. His lieutenant Pedro is a worse example, as his name is very, very rarely said despite being a relatively important character (heck, he does have a name, never gets killed, is always behind Hernán on screen and once slept with Lucrecia).
Aguila Roja	Evil Brit	The captain Patrick Walcott.
Aguila Roja	Evil Counterpart	Sung-Yi to Gonzalo, though she is more immoral than evil.
Aguila Roja	Evil Twin	Sátur gets one. We are never told his name, if he does have one.
Aguila Roja	Expy	Eva de Almeida certainly echoes Irene Adler.
Aguila Roja	Eye Scream	The bald jailer loses an eye in the first season to a dagger attack by Águila. Later, Lucrecia suffers the same fate to a falcon.
Aguila Roja	Fanservice Extra	A lot in each episode.
Aguila Roja	Fashionable Asymmetry	Hernán's signature fencing jacket. It is later revealed to be actually the Sheriff uniform.
Aguila Roja	Fat Bastard	The pawnbroker Manrique. He is quite obese and has a thoroughly creepy view towards children.
Aguila Roja	Femme Fatale	Eva, although surprisingly well dissembled.
Aguila Roja	Flanderization	For several seasons, Alonso did not have more personality than his tendency to blame his father for everything and childishly rant against him at every opportunity. In the fifth season he had some character development, but later fell again on the trend.
Aguila Roja	Giant Mook	Hernán's jailer. He is bald, hunchbacked and (later) one-eyed, but above all he is a really big guy. The city's executioner also counts, as he is huge as well.
Aguila Roja	Gratuitous Ninja	The show can be described as Alatriste if he was a ninja.
Aguila Roja	Graying Morality	The show starts out as a stereotypical Black-and-White Morality story, but in later seasons it becomes more of a Gray-and-Gray Morality one (although never gets rid of its Black-and-White Morality undertones).
Aguila Roja	Green-Eyed Monster	Happens often with regard to many of the show's couples: Gonzalo and Margarita, Hernán and Lucrecia, Irene and Nuño, etc.
Aguila Roja	The Guards Must Be Crazy	Played to a ridiculous degree with the Santillana palace, to the point that you have to wonder if they really have guards in the first place. Beggars, killers, madmen and even a loud-mouthed British platoon can sneak into the palace without being noticed.
Aguila Roja	Heartbroken Badass	Gonzalo, in the first season.
Aguila Roja	Heroic BSoD	Gonzalo has had many over the course of the show, but the worse one yet happens in the season 8 finale.
Aguila Roja	Hero Protagonist	Gonzalo/Águila Roja, while Hernán is Gonzalo's Deuteragonist and Villain Protagonist. However, whether he is actually a hero is entirely debatable.
Aguila Roja	Heterosexual Life-Partners	Gonzalo and Sátur. Sátur: “Master, you're the best thing that's ever happened to me. And no matter what happens, that's never going to change.”
Aguila Roja	Hidden Depths	Hernán and Sátur start out as the classic Arch-Enemy and Plucky Comic Relief of the series respectively, but throughout the series they both prove to be very complex and well-rounded characters who have an Undying Loyalty towards their loved ones.
Aguila Roja	I'm a Humanitarian	Sebastián Ventura. Not only is he good killing people with his teeth, but he also fests in his preys. The guy merely talks about how he once devoured an Amazonian indigenous chief.
Aguila Roja	Interchangeable Asian Cultures	Big time. On one hand, Gonzalo always mentions China as his place of training, Sung-Yi is obviously Chinese in her facial features and accent, and there is a story arc about the kidnapped son of the Emperor of China. On the other hand, Gonzalo is a ninja and she is a kunoichi, they speak Japanese during their reencounter, and several flashbacks (including the ones shown in the aforementioned arc) shows them training in Japanese martial arts with Japanese imagery. At the end it is implied that they trained in both lands, but the matter is still confusing, and it seems that the producers are not willing to clear it up.
Aguila Roja	Invincible Hero	Gonzalo evolves into this after several seasons, as the show pretty much stops trying to bring antagonists who can pose a threat to him.
Aguila Roja	Hero Killer	To date, Sung-Yi is the only antagonist who is solidly portrayed as more badass than him. She actually almost kills him in the first duel.
Aguila Roja	Historical Fiction	With the historical part being quite low, but still.
Aguila Roja	Hunting the Most Dangerous Game	Alonso finds himself as prey when he accepts a shady proposal from a group of aristocrats.
Aguila Roja	I Am a Humanitarian	The "giant" in the forest and of course Malasangre.
Aguila Roja	Imperial Stormtrooper Marksmanship Academy	Many, but especially Hernán's soldiers. They usually miss their shots, and whenever they don't miss, Águila dodges them.
Aguila Roja	Incompatible Orientation	Soledad is hopelessly in love with Lucrecia of all people.
Aguila Roja	In the Back	Sátur gets a memorable one when Gonzalo takes down a bunch of mooks and another one attempts inadvertently to backstab him, only for Sátur to jump into the mook's back and knock him out with a stone.
Aguila Roja	I Owe You My Life	The reason Gonzalo tries to rescue pirate Richard Blake.
Aguila Roja	It's All About Me	Lucrecia tends to think this way.
Aguila Roja	It's All My Fault	Sátur and Alonso tend to think this way whenever something bad happens and they think they could have prevented it or done something about it.
Aguila Roja	Jerk with a Heart of Gold	Hernán and Lucrecia have their moments.
Aguila Roja	Just in Time	Águila Roja tends to save the day with seconds to spare.
Aguila Roja	Killed Off for Real	Many characters have been Killed Off for Real. Among the main characters, excluding Cristina who died in the Pilot, Floro, Agustín, Inés, Laura and Catalina all have been killed off.
Aguila Roja	Knight of Cerebus	The series is pretty dark from its very start, but the fake Águila Roja turns it up to eleven.
Aguila Roja	Kung Fu-Proof Mook	Eva's cloaked mook, who seemed to know Karate and Gun Fu. Amazingly enough, he would have stuck a bullet in Gonzalo's head if his gun had not conveniently jammed while he had him in point blank.
Aguila Roja	Left Hanging	
Aguila Roja	Like an Old Married Couple	Gonzalo and Sátur. Hernán and Lucrecia.
Aguila Roja	Like You Were Dying	Before departing, Santiago reveals that he was actually dying and that he wanted to see his friend Sátur one last time.
Aguila Roja	Lipstick Lesbian	Soledad.
Aguila Roja	Love Dodecahedron	The main love triangle of the show is Margarita/Gonzalo/Lucrecia/Hernán, although there are many other love triangles during the course of the show. Some examples include: Lucrecia/Hernan/Irene, Gonzalo/Margarita/Juan, Hernan/Irene/Nuño, etc.
Aguila Roja	Love Father, Love Son	Irene has cheated on Hernán with  Nuño, who is Hernán's son and her own nephew.
Aguila Roja	Love Hurts	
Aguila Roja	Love Makes You Crazy	When it comes to Hernán and Lucrecia's relationship, this is quite an understatement.
Aguila Roja	Love Martyr	Gonzalo and Hernán show alarming signs of being this with their loved ones, including (and especially) each other.
Aguila Roja	Loves My Alter Ego	Margarita develops feelings for Águila Roja, albeit briefly.
Aguila Roja	Luke, I Am Your Father	Hernán reveals this to Nuño in the eighth season.
Aguila Roja	Made a Slave	Happens to Margarita in episodes 2x03 and 2x04, when she is abducted by Barbary Pirates... near Madrid (It Makes Sense in Context). The plotline comes complete with:
Aguila Roja	Man Hug	Many times between Gonzalo and Sátur.
Aguila Roja	Manipulative Bastard	Cardinal Mendoza, Hernán, Lucrecia, Malasangre... Even the King.
Aguila Roja	Marital Rape License	Happened to Lucrecia in one episode from Season 2.
Aguila Roja	McNinja	Gonzalo is Spanish and Sung-Yi is Chinese, but nobody cares.
Aguila Roja	Marriage of Convenience	Hernán and Irene's marriage.
Aguila Roja	Ms. Fanservice	Marchioness Lucrecia, and in later seasons Irene too.
Aguila Roja	The Movie	Involves an adventure in three European countries.
Aguila Roja	Murder Is the Best Solution	Hernán and Lucrecia, among other characters, resort to murder in many occasions.
Aguila Roja	My Country, Right or Wrong	Those were the real life values of the time, though only a few characters actually believe in them.
Aguila Roja	Never Trust a Trailer	
Aguila Roja	No Historical Figures Were Harmed	
Aguila Roja	Non-Serial Movie	The movie is a subversion, as it is canonically placed in the series's timeline and its events are later brought again.
Aguila Roja	Parental Substitute	Agustín is this to Gonzalo, and to some degree, to Hernán as well. There's also Hernán towards Nuño, until it's revealed that he's actually Nuño's biological father.
Aguila Roja	Protagonist-Centered Morality	
Aguila Roja	Puppy Love	Alonso and Matilde, though it does not last long.
Aguila Roja	Put on a Bus	
Aguila Roja	Really Gets Around	Lucrecia is the queen of the trope. Only on-screen she sleeps with more or less every non-plebeian character with a name, including Hernán, Gonzalo, the King, the Cardinal Mendoza and Pedro, along with several unnamed noblemen.
Aguila Roja	Red Baron	Sebastián Ventura is known as "Malasangre" ("Bad-blood"), for obvious reasons.
Aguila Roja	Revenge Before Reason	Gonzalo, Hernán and other characters can sometimes get completely consumed by their thirst for revenge.
Aguila Roja	Rule of Cool	The show lives on it.
Aguila Roja	Running Gag	The main is Sátur complaining about his lack of an elaborated costume like Gonzalo's, but there are many other examples.
Aguila Roja	Samus Is a Girl	The Oriental Warrior is a woman, and her name is Sung-Yi.
Aguila Roja	Satellite Love Interest	Margarita and Irene end up becoming this, the former for Gonzalo/Juan/Adrián and the latter for Nuño/Hernán/Martin.
Aguila Roja	Save the Villain	This show has an interesting and rare case, as Gonzalo/Águila Roja always saves and protects his enemy, Hernán. Justified in that Hernán is actually his brother, so Gonzalo refuses to kill him or let him die. The Season 8 premiere revolves entirely around this trope, with Gonzalo, Sátur, Lucrecia and Nuño all ultimately trying to save Hernán.
Aguila Roja	Secret Relationship	
Aguila Roja	Scary Black Man	The coast pirate band features a big black guy who fights with a giant axe and tends to blindly charge towards his opponent.
Aguila Roja	Shoot the Rope	Gonzalo does it several times with his shurikens throughout the series, although, uncharacteristically enough, he sometimes requires two of them to hit the rope.
Aguila Roja	Shout-Out	
Aguila Roja	Single-Stroke Battle	The first duel between Águila and the Oriental Warrior ends like this, and surprisingly, it's Águila who falls.
Aguila Roja	The Stoic	Hernán, Lucrecia, Cardinal Mendoza, the King, and to some extent, Gonzalo as well.
Aguila Roja	Sugar-and-Ice Personality	Hernán. He is cold and cruel to people in general but shows an immense affection towards Lucrecia, Nuño and much later in the show, Gonzalo. Likewise with Lucrecia when it comes to Gonzalo, Hernán and Nuño.
Aguila Roja	Swashbuckler	Missing the fun side for a big part, given the fact that the series fuels greatly in drama, but otherwise fits the genre.
Aguila Roja	Sympathy for the Hero	Hernán, in turn, sympathizes with Gonzalo as well but much later on, from late Season 6 onwards.
Aguila Roja	Tap on the Head	Used constantly: characters knock each other fully unconscious for minutes with all kind of strikes. Especially interesting is Malasangre, who manages to knock out both Hernán and Gonzalo separately with a professional but hilariously fake-looking double hammerfist to the back.
Aguila Roja	Technical Pacifist	Gonzalo teaches against violence, but Águila Roja will certainly maim and kill to stop the evildoers.
Aguila Roja	Throwing Your Sword Always Works	Occasionally, and yes, it always works. In the film, Gonzalo even makes it work with his crossbow.
Aguila Roja	Took a Level in Jerkass	After Hernán's demotion from Sheriff, his lieutenant Pedro doesn't hesitate a single second to take the opportunity and verbally spit Hernán in the face the next time he sees him. Granted, the old guy was not the kindest boss ever and his law enforcement style was clearly irregular, but up to that point Pedro had been shown to be very loyal to Hernán and receive a (relatively) good treatment back from him, and the lieutenant himself is shown to be just as disdainful towards the commoners as the former Sheriff. His refusal to support Hernán in the slightest comes as quite shocking.
Aguila Roja	Ungrateful Bastard	
Aguila Roja	Unknown Character	The Japanese ninja master who trained Gonzalo and Sung-Yi only appears in one flashback and it's never mentioned again. Even when more flashbacks of Gonzalo's training are brought up, he is replaced or recast by another actor.
Aguila Roja	Unresolved Sexual Tension	Gonzalo and Margarita. It is finally resolved in the eighth season, albeit  it barely lasts.
Aguila Roja	The Un-Reveal	The fake Águila's identity and face are left unrevealed at the end of the episode, as it would be pointless, given that they know he was simply some unknown madman.
Aguila Roja	Vile Villain, Saccharine Show	Granted, nobody sane would call Águila Roja a "saccharine show", but the Fake Águila basically makes all the villains until the moment look like charity sisters.
Aguila Roja	Villainous Breakdown	Happens to Lucrecia at least once every season. Hernán undergoes this quite a few times throughout the series too, especially in the last two episodes of Season 4, and it just goes downhill from there, as the seventh and (especially) eighth seasons are even worse for him. He falls apart completely in the season 8 finale.
Aguila Roja	What a Drag	The bounty hunter hired by Lucrecia to kill Malasangre takes him down off his horse with a pretty badass lasso.
Aguila Roja	Wilhelm Scream	At least once every episode.
Aguila Roja	Wolverine Claws	In season 7, Hernán gains a gauntlet with spiky metal fingers to replace his lost fingertips. Also, back in the first season, Lucrecia's murderous brother used bracelets with long blades attached.
Aguila Roja	The Worf Effect	If a character survives a fight against Águila, he will probably kick his ass later, although he invariably will be defeated at the end.
Aguila Roja	Worthy Opponent	Gonzalo and Hernán. Cardinal Mendoza and Malasangre.
Aguila Roja	Wrestler in All of Us	Águila lariats an enemy down in his rush to save the King from the university revolutionaries in Season 7. Also, in season 8, the unnamed bald fighter in Malasangre's team chokeslams opponents several times on screen.
Aguila Roja	You Are Better than You Think You Are	Gonzalo usually says this to Sátur whenever he speaks badly of himself, which happens often due to Sátur's self-esteem issues.
Aguila Roja	You Have Failed Me	Hernán and the cardinal Mendoza are prone to this with their mooks.
Aguila Roja	Young Future Famous People	Implied at least - one of Gonzalo's pupils is a kid with a talent for drawing, whose name is Murillo.
Aikatsu Planet	Always in Class One	Mao and Shiori are in Class 1-A.
Aikatsu Planet	Be Yourself	The Central Theme, considering the concept of Aikatsu Planet.
Aikatsu Planet	Catch Phrase	Shiori's "Here's a question for you" and Beat's "ja nai?"
Aikatsu Planet	Chekhov's Gun	Shiori asks Mao about the identity of Hana's performer and then Mao crashes into someone who drops a costume token.  Mao ends the episode as Hana's performer, since the person she crashed into is Meisa, Hana's current performer, who was heading overseas after quitting Starlet Promotion.
Aikatsu Planet	Color-Coded Characters	Hana is pink, Ruli is blue, Beat is red, Shiori is light green, Q-pit is green, Ann is lavender, Rose is magenta, and Sala is orange.
Aikatsu Planet	Costume Porn	Especially the Premium Rare dresses.
Aikatsu Planet	Curtains Match the Window	Technically applies to everyone now that the show is live-action. But as avatars, Ruli, Q-pit, Ann, Sala, and Rose.

Aikatsu Planet	Everything's Better with Sparkles	Carried over from previous Aikatsu! installments, the performances are heavy with special effects.
Aikatsu Planet	Evolution Power-Up	The Dressia are eventually revealed to be able to evolve through a phenomenon called "Dressiup".
Aikatsu Planet	Evolving Credits	The ending features a photograph sequence of every episode.
Aikatsu Planet	Faceless Masses	Averted, for the most part, since the live action segments avert the trope entirely, and, as with previous Aikatsu! installments, background characters typically have their own unique designs. However, similar to most other series, they are rendered as faceless masses during performances when attention should naturally be on the idols on stage.
Aikatsu Planet	Fairy Tale	The motif for Story Dressia. Shiori, as an avid lover of fairy tales, naturally gravitates towards using them.
Aikatsu Planet	The Fashionista	Ruli, who is the producer of her own fashion brand, Melty House. Also Sala, who is the dress designer for Starlet Promotion.
Aikatsu Planet	Feud Episode	Episode 19 features Mao and Shiori having their first fight.
Aikatsu Planet	Friendly Rivalry	Between all of the main characters, really.
Aikatsu Planet	Friendship Song	Mao and Shiori write an original song called "Soulmate" which they perform in their first battle stage against each other. Rose and Q-pit later borrow it when they face off in the Grand Prix semifinals.
Aikatsu Planet	Friendship-Straining Competition	Subverted. When Hana and Shiori are pit against each other for a spot in the Planet Princess Grand Prix, Mao is worried their friendship is over when Shiori starts avoiding her. They reconcile when Mao realizes that all Shiori wanted was for her to take their rivalry seriously instead of holding back like she always does for her.
Aikatsu Planet	Frilly Upgrade	When the Dressia evolve into their ultimate forms, their dresses also change to become more elaborate.
Aikatsu Planet	Group Hug	With the main four after Hana loses her battle stage against Rose.
Aikatsu Planet	Impossible Task	The Planet Marathon, an event where idols have to perform after running a whole marathon. Q-pit and Beat become the first to complete it successfully.
Aikatsu Planet	Instant Expert	Mao is all over this, managing to teach a group of dancers how to do Hip-Hop in a ridiculously short time, and, in Mao's first battle stage as Hana, she beats Q-pit who in that time was second on the Aikatsu Ranking. Shiori also beats Ruli in her first battle stage. Subverted in later episodes where they do end up losing sometimes.
Aikatsu Planet	Medium Blending	A first for an Aikatsu! series, being half live-action and half-anime. The live-action follows the girls' everyday lives but switches to anime when they become idol avatars in the world of Aikatsu Planet!.
Aikatsu Planet	Meaningful Name	The main characters' names all allude to their preferred Dressia type.
Aikatsu Planet	The Mentor	Meisa is shaping up to be one for Mao, as per tradition.
Aikatsu Planet	Mentor Mascot	The Dressia, to an extent.
Aikatsu Planet	Merchandise-Driven	
Aikatsu Planet	No Antagonist	As with previous Aikatsu! installments, the conflict of the series is largely centered around the girls as rivals.
Aikatsu Planet	Odd Friendship	There are many moments where the girls acknowledge how well they get along despite their different personalities. Ruli and Kyoko even consider that if it hadn't been for Aikatsu!, they likely would have never interacted outside of exchanging greetings in the school hallways.
Aikatsu Planet	One-Gender School	Averted. For the first time in Aikatsu!, Seirei Private High School sees the idols attending class with males, with even the co-ed Four Star Academy having separated its students by gender.
Aikatsu Planet	The One Guy	Segawa, who is the only male at Starlet.
Aikatsu Planet	Only One Name	The avatars.
Aikatsu Planet	Pimped-Out Dress	The Premium Rare dresses.
Aikatsu Planet	Pinball Protagonist	Mao at first spends much of the time basically picking up where Meisa left off and doing all of Hana's jobs that Izumi accepts for her. It isn't until the announcement of the Planet Princess Grand Prix that she becomes more active.
Aikatsu Planet	Pop-Culture Pun Episode Title	All of the episodes are titled after famous Japanese songs. Episode 22 has them title it after the show's opening theme, which is fitting considering it's The Climax.
Aikatsu Planet	Power Gives You Wings	As per Aikatsu! tradition, the outfits derived from the Dressia's ultimate forms come with wings.
Aikatsu Planet	Protagonist Power-Up Privileges	Hana is the first of the main characters to get a second Premium Rare Dressia.
Aikatsu Planet	The Rival	Ayumi and Meisa. Mao is slowly being integrated to form a three-way rivalry.
Aikatsu Planet	Roger Rabbit Effect	Used in the intro and when the girls "mirror in" to Aikatsu Planet!.
Aikatsu Planet	Secret-Keeper	As a result of Mao and Kyoko keeping their idol identities secret in the first few episodes.
Aikatsu Planet	Slumber Party	The main four hold one at Mao's house, which Shiori claims is a "training camp" for Hana's battle stage with Rose.
Aikatsu Planet	Team Hand-Stack	With the main four right before Hana has her first battle stage with Rose.
Aikatsu Planet	Technician Versus Performer	Ayumi is shown to be an extremely hard-worker who is continually refining her skills, while Meisa is presented as a prodigy who focuses on freedom and is more natural on stage.
Aikatsu Planet	Those Two Guys	Mao and Shiori's classmates, Keito and Sho. Although they're also part of trio with Ryoka.
Aikatsu Planet	Tournament Arc	Starting Episode 12, the characters start preparing for the Planet Princess Grand Prix, which the top four idols on the Aikatsu Ranking participate in. The actual competition itself only spans from Episode 21-22.
Aikatsu Planet	Western Zodiac	The motif for Q-pit's preferred Horoscope Dressia.
Aikatsu Planet	Winged Humanoid	The ultimate form of the Dressia has them turn into this.
Aikatsu Planet	The Worf Effect	Several instances, most notably Q-pit, who is the current top idol but is beaten twice by Mao's Hana. Ruli also loses to Shiori during the latter's debut stage.
Ahsoka	Ambiguous Situation	For most of the episodes it is made ambiguous if Sabine's training under Ahsoka will allow her to use the Force, and if some of the things she does is because of it. She manages to parry blaster bolts, land attacks while sparing with Ahsoka blindfolded and senses Ahsoka's arrival before Ezra does when Ahsoka calls out to her but it is not made clear if that was luck and a part of the Force that everyone has. It is not until the final episode that she is actively able to call upon the Force.
Ahsoka	Anxiety Dreams	In the first two episodes Sabine is shown to be suffering from dreams bad enough to make her fidget about in bed. The first one has her shooting up and calling Ezra's name. The second one, Ahsoka, presumably feeling Sabine's distress, wakes her up to put a stop to it.
Ahsoka	Broad Strokes	Ahsoka has elements of The Thrawn Trilogy, though it's not a direct adaptation. Thrawn returning and uniting scattered Imperial remnants under his leadership is a major threat, which is what had happened at the start of the novels, and the New Republic largely refuses to accept his threat as legitimate until it's too late, which also happened in the novels. The main difference is that Thrawn isn't just in a remote backwater of the Empire, returning to take command five years after the Empire was scattered at Endor, but was whisked to parts unknown at the conclusion of Star Wars Rebels. This turns out to be a whole other galaxy, and the bulk of the series is about the attempts by Imperials to get there and rescue Thrawn, or Ahsoka and Sabine to get there and rescue Ezra. The finale features Thrawn making his way back to the Star Wars galaxy, with resources and loyal allies who will potentially allow him assume a place similar to what he had at the start of The Thrawn Trilogy.
Ahsoka	Badass Normal	Sabine cannot use the Force, something Shin taunts her about. However, she is a Mandalorian warrior who was trained in the use of a lightsaber by Kanan and Ezra, and later Ahsoka, making her one of the few people in the galaxy who can cross blades with a Force-user and hold their own. She ultimately becomes an Empowered Badass Normal as her lessons with Ahsoka pay off and she becomes capable of actually using the Force.
Ahsoka	The Bad Guy Wins	At the end of the first season, the heroes fail to prevent Thrawn from escaping Peridea, meaning that the New Republic will soon have to deal with him back in their galaxy ready to resume his campaign of terror.
Ahsoka	Because Destiny Says So	Morgan clearly believes that it's her destiny to bring Thrawn back from his exile, referring to "fate" in the first two episodes as deciding her next moves. The Great Mothers of the Nightsisters are revealed to view the Force as the Thread, providing more context to Morgan's beliefs.
Ahsoka	Big Damn Reunion	Three times, in fact. First up, Sabine is the one who reunites with Ezra Bridger in Part Six, "Far, Far Away". In the next episode, it's Ahsoka's turn to give a hug to the stranded galactic hero. And finally, in the season finale, "The Jedi, the Witch and the Warlord", Ezra reunites with Chopper and Hera.
Ahsoka	Black Knight	A new Inquisitor is introduced called Marrok, and he has a distinctly knight-inspired design.
Ahsoka	Bling of War	The Night Troopers that serve under Thrawn have the cracks in their armor filled in with gold, which gives them an appearance reminiscent of kintsugi.
Ahsoka	Broken Pedestal	Baylan alludes to this, stating that while everyone in the Jedi Order knew Anakin, few lived to see his turn as Vader.
Ahsoka	The Bus Came Back	
Ahsoka	Call-Back	Sabine's Important Haircut in episode 2 with the way she is kneeling before a table with her helmet on it, slowly picking up a knife and inspecting it before cutting off her hair, is reminiscent of her mentor and father figure Kanan doing the same in the Rebels episode "Jedi Night".
Ahsoka	The Cameo	One of the X-Wing pilots in the fourth and fifth episodes is played by Brendan Wayne, one of Pedro Pascal's body doubles in The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett.
Ahsoka	Casting Gag	
Ahsoka	Child Soldiers	The fifth episode emphasizes that Ahsoka was quite young during the Clone Wars when she was Anakin's apprentice, with a far more realistic take on it than the mostly lighthearted adventures of The Clone Wars animated series.
Ahsoka	Circling Saw	Ahsoka is seen exploring the ruins and stops at one point, cutting the ground in a circle around herself with her lightsabers and lets herself fall in a crypt below.
Ahsoka	Colour-Coded for Your Convenience	Baylan and Shin wield orange light sabers, rather than the tradition red of the Sith. This serves as a sign that, while they may be ruthless and not good people, they might not be as evil as the villains we've seen in the past. Baylan certainly hints that he's Necessarily Evil and wants a good end.
Ahsoka	Continuity Nod	
Ahsoka	Cool Ship	A few standout examples.
Ahsoka	Dramatic Irony	Senator Xiono dismisses the Imperial Remnant as a group of disorganized rogue warlords who don't pose a threat to the New Republic. This is exactly what Captain Pellaeon was hoping for, as the audience members who have already watched Season 3 of The Mandalorian will already know, as he stressed the need for the Remnant to keep a low profile to trick the New Republic into believing this so they could bide their time to regroup and replenish their ranks.
Ahsoka	Fantasy Counterpart Culture	Peridea seems to be In-Universe Feudal Japan. It's a closed off and isolated planet from the rest of civilization located in another galaxy, much like Japan used to be during the Edo Period. It has an alien native species dressed in red samurai-like armor and carrying Naginatas with them, and another one called the Noti which actually speaks Japanese. Thrawn even says that Peridea is where a Rōnin like Ahsoka belongs.
Ahsoka	Foil	Within the series, Ahsoka and Sabine are contrasted with Baylan and Shin. Ahsoka and Sabine are a master and apprentice pair brought together by fate and circumstance whose conflicting ideologies are exemplified by their differing choice of attire and lightsabers. Baylan and Shin are a master and apprentice who are much more alike in goals and motives, whose singular objective shows them having near identical clothes and lightsabers.
Ahsoka	Guys Smash, Girls Shoot	Ezra focused on martial arts and the force in his fighting from the beginning while Sabine mixed lightsaber and blaster use. She did better with the latter prior to being able to embrace the Force. Ahsoka averts this as she is full melee with lightsabers and the force.
Ahsoka	Good Cannot Comprehend Evil	At the end of "Toil and Trouble", Hera expresses disbelief that so many people are still loyal to the fallen Empire and are conspiring to rebuild what's left of it. To that, Ahsoka bitterly remarks that the Imperial Remnants and their sympathizers are not motivated by loyalty so much as Greed. Most are willing to begin the Empire anew and sacrifice the entire galaxy's newfound freedom — the very thing the Rebellion fought so hard to achieve by ending the Empire — solely for personal gain.
Ahsoka	Greater-Scope Paragon	Leia Organa hasn't directly appeared so far, but she still provides as much cover as possible for Hera and Ahsoka since the New Republic Senate Committee is too ignorant and unwilling to do anything about Morgan Elsbeth trying to bring Thrawn back from his exile. In the penultimate episode she bails Hera out of a hearing that was likely heading for her termination from her command.
Ahsoka	Greater-Scope Villain	As the series goes on, Moff Gideon is established as this up until at least the seventh episode, which is explicitly set after the events of Season 3 of The Mandalorian in which he is killed in the season finale. His Purge of Mandalore turns out to have been the cause of much of Ahsoka and Sabine's tension that drives most of the series, since Sabine was devastated by losing her entire family to the massacre, and Ahsoka abandoned her training of her out of fear of Sabine falling to the Dark Side as a consequence.
Ahsoka	Hallway Fight	Baylan is seen in the first episode fighting New Republic soldiers while calmly strolling down a corridor on his way to rescuing Morgan Elsbeth from her holding cell.
Ahsoka	Head-in-the-Sand Management	The New Republic's leaders, including now-Chancellor Mon Mothma herself, are shown to be this. Most of the Senate Committee are unwilling to entertain the idea of the Imperial Remant posing any threat, believe that any former Imperial working for the New Republic are automatically loyal to them, and many of them didn't even fight in the war and don't have as much of a personal stake in trying to keep the Empire from returning. Mothma knows how dire the return of Thrawn would be, but due to not wanting to come across as another Palpatine, she is usually unwilling to put her foot down on the scale in any way. This allows Senator Xiono to launch an unprofessional smear campaign against Hera that Mothma doesn't do anything to stop and nearly culminates in the termination of her command until Leia steps in to save her.
Ahsoka	Hourglass Plot	At the start of the series, Ahsoka, Sabine, Baylan, and Shin are seeking a way to another galaxy where Ezra and Thrawn are stranded. At the end of the season finale, Ezra and Thrawn have returned to the main galaxy, while Ahsoka, Sabine, Baylan, and Shin are now stranded in the other galaxy.
Ahsoka	Important Haircut	Sabine has let her hair grow long during her time on Lothal. The second episode has her cutting it short with a knife when deciding to accompany Ahsoka as her apprentice, matching her appearance in the Distant Finale of Rebels. Ahsoka: Nice haircut.
Ahsoka	In Medias Res	The series opens with Ahsoka and Sabine's relationship being frosty because the former discontinued the latter's Jedi training, but these events were never referenced or depicted until now. It's not until the final episode that the full truth of the situation comes out.
Ahsoka	Knight and Samurai	Invoked with the competing groups of Force users.
Ahsoka	Undying Loyalty	Sabine is totally devoted to Ezra coming home.  This trope is subverted in episode 4, where it is made clear that her desire to get Ezra back is caused by emotional issues, rather than a true sense of loyalty towards him.
Ahsoka	Unequal Rites	
Ahsoka	Vader Breath	
Ahsoka	Laser Blade	We get the return of Ahsoka's white lightsabers and get introduced to a pair of lightsaber wielders known as Baylan and Shin, whose blades are a dull ember orange (the cores of which appear to fluctuate between the standard white and a more exotic yellow). We also see Sabine using Ezra's green lightsaber, and an Inquisitor named Marrok using the typical red spinning lightsaber used by his fellow members of the now defunct Inquisitorius. Anakin is seen wielding a recreation of his blue lightsaber while as a Force Ghost, which turns red when he begins evoking his Vader persona. Ahsoka's original lightsabers are also seen during flashbacks. And in the first season finale, Ezra builds a new lightsaber, his third, closely modeled on Kanan's, complete with a blue blade.
Ahsoka	Legendary in the Sequel	For their heroics during the Galactic Civil War and the Liberation of Lothal, Ahsoka and the Ghost crew are shown to all have become famous heroes in their own right. Hera remains one of the New Republic's top generals, Ahsoka is now known as a wandering do-gooder around the galaxy, and Ryder Azadi holds a celebration every anniversary of Lothal's liberation to honor the Ghost crew, particularly Ezra who is believed to have given his life to defeat Thrawn. This also comes into play in the second episode when Hera and Ahsoka enter a facility on Corellia populated with many who used to work for the Empire, and give them pointed glares since they're still loyal to the old regime.
Ahsoka	Leitmotif	A new version of Sabine's theme song from Rebels plays during the credits, or at the very least is mixed into it.
Ahsoka	MacGuffin	The Star Map is the object of search and archaeological investigation that motivates the initial conflict between the Master and Apprentice teams of Baylan and Shin, and Ahsoka and Sabine, respectively. Halfway through the series Baylan destroys it once his side has no further use of it and to keep anyone from following them.
Ahsoka	Male Might, Female Finesse	Baylan has a far more heavy and slow lightsaber form which is reminiscent of using a great sword like a Claymore, compared to the more agile forms used by Ahsoka, Sabine, and Shin.
Ahsoka	Meaningful Name	
Ahsoka	The Milky Way Is the Only Way	The series introduces intergalactic travel for the first time in a live action installment of the franchise. It also shows that existing technology can produce a ship capable of making the journey so long as navigational coordinates to the destination are available. Further, it is revealed that the Nightsisters of Dathomir originated in this other galaxy, and that their planet, Peridea, has some unrevealed connection to the Mortis gods as well. The Jedi Order apparently knew about this in the past.
Ahsoka	Mythology Gag	
Ahsoka	Never Trust a Trailer	The trailers feature a voiceover by Ahsoka refering to Thrawn as "Heir to the Empire". But when this term is used in the show itself, it is part of a completely different line.
Ahsoka	Once More, with Clarity	The episode revisits a scene from the Star Wars Rebels finale, where Sabine visits a mural to the Ghost crew before embarking on a mission with Ahsoka, but now we have a lot more context about the state of Sabine and Ahsoka's relationship and exactly what leads they're following to find Ezra.
Ahsoka	Present Absence	Thrawn and Ezra don't appear until Part 6 (outside of Ezra appearing in a years-old holographic recording in the first episode), but their absence is felt by everyone looking for them — or, in Thrawn's case, those who fear his return.
Ahsoka	Protection in Mouth	When the Eye of Sion escapes to the other galaxy and the protagonists have no means of pursuing, Ahsoka gets the idea to hitch a ride in a mouth of a massive purgill, which can naturally fly between galaxies.
Ahsoka	The Reveal	
Ahsoka	Retcon	The final scene of Chapter 2 is a Shot-for-Shot Remake of the epilogue scene in Rebels, though there are some distinct differences. Namely, Sabine no longer puts on her helmet before leaving, and Ahsoka herself is wearing a completely different outfit and lacking the staff she was holding.
Ahsoka	Rule of Three	Baylan and Shin's quips about witchcraft. Part 2 has Shin calling Morgan Elsbeth a witch, which the latter does not take likely and corrects to be "a survivor", before calling Shin "This one" when ordering Baylan to send her to confront Sabine. Episode 4 has Baylan himself muttering "witchcraft" in disgust after his concern about the calculations of the coordinates to Thrawn was met of a quip of "have faith" (which he felt he has lost). The third took place at the first meeting of the great mothers with Shin quipping "More witches?".
Ahsoka	Schrödinger's Canon	
Ahsoka	Sequel Hook	The first season ends with a lot opened plotlines to be resolved in the second season:
Ahsoka	Sequel Series	Ahsoka is a de facto continuation of Star Wars Rebels due to bringing back every living member of the main cast of that series (with the exception of Zeb, who cameoed in the third season of The Mandalorian, though he will appear in the second season) and picking up the loose plot threads of Ezra Bridger and Grand Admiral Thrawn's fates after the war.
Ahsoka	Serial Escalation	The galaxy far far, away is joined by a partner galaxy even further away, reachable only thanks to an ancient star map built by an ancient, unknown race. Reaching it requires a supersized hyperspace ring, a technology introduced in the prequel trilogy for individual starfighters, built to the scale of a Star Destroyer. The only other beings that can travel that far are the Purgill.
Ahsoka	Ship Tease	Regarding what Ezra said in his message to Sabine, claiming he saw her as a "sister", she ironiclly seems to be carrying more of a torch in this time around than she did during Rebels as she's taken up residence in his old tower, wearing similar clothes to him and wasn't shown to have settled with anyone else in a relationship, while waiting for him to come home. This is further shown in her desperation to find him, like when she gave Baylon Skoll the map rather destroy what she assumed was the only chance to reunite with him. When she finally reunites with him, their hug nearly resembles a Kissing Discretion Shot, even though they don't kiss.

Alas Smith And Jones	Namesake Gag	A sketch about László Bíró, the inventor of the ballpoint pen. This is true.

Agents Of SHIELD	Ancient Conspiracy	HYDRA.

As a religious devotee, Malick may be stretching the truth or misinformed. Hive's true appearance does a good job of matching HYDRA's symbol, but the group sending people through the portal centuries ago used a different symbol, a ram's head. They might have merged, some members might have lost faith and branched out... who knows?

Agents Of SHIELD	Artistic License – Linguistics	As weird as it may appear, the official language of Belarus is... Russian.

Agents Of SHIELD	Artistic License – Physics	
Agents Of SHIELD	Artistic License – Religion	Eliot Randolf claimed that he was canonized as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church.

Agents Of SHIELD	Badass Bureaucrat	Jeffrey Mace is quite adept when it comes to dealing with the officials and paperwork that is part of S.H.I.E.L.D. He also happens to be super strong and super tough. Of course, that's all just for show, as his super strength and toughness are derived from a serum based off of Cal's serum.

A couple episodes later, Ward insists that S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't have truth serum and he was only pretending to be under the influence. The training scenes in "The Asset" arguably turn it into Unresolved Sexual Tension.
Agents Of SHIELD	The Bermuda Triangle	When finding out the Kree city is located in Puerto Rico, Triplett wonders if that is in the Bermuda Triangle and it would explain a lot of things. Turns out S.H.I.E.L.D. already took care of the Bermuda mystery in the 80s.
Agents Of SHIELD	Beware the Nice Ones	
Agents Of SHIELD	Cartwright Curse	The team sure goes through a lot of love interests, with the most common cause of turnover being Ward and/or Hive. As of the end of season 3:
Agents Of SHIELD	Big Bad	The show typically uses a big bad shuffle throughout the season, often correlating with a particular Myth Arc at the time, and every season but the first has had more than one singular big bad. However, the antagonist organization for most of the show is HYDRA, and the only season where HYDRA isn't directly related to the Big Bad of the season or responsible for the conflict is Season 6.
Agents Of SHIELD	The Big Bad Shuffle	The show loves to play with this. Sometimes it throws a Big Bad Ensemble at us, sometimes it moves from A to B to C, sometimes it's one Big Bad the whole time but we're confused about who it is...
Agents Of SHIELD	Big Bad Friend	
Agents Of SHIELD	Big Brother Is Watching	Ian Quinn believes this of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Skye does too (initially) but later says they're the "Nice Big Brother". In the following episode Coulson states that social media makes his job easier every year. "People surveil themselves."
Agents Of SHIELD	Big Damn Heroes	
Agents Of SHIELD	The Big Damn Kiss	
Agents Of SHIELD	The Big Guy	
Agents Of SHIELD	Big "NO!"	
Agents Of SHIELD	Big, Screwed-Up Family	The Ward family. Grant and his brother, Christian, were physically abused by their mom, while their dad turned a blind eye to it. Her third son, Thomas, was treated well because she liked him. Christian wanted to hurt him to get back at his mom, but he didn't have the stomach for it, so he made Grant do it for him. Eventually Grant snapped and tried to burn down the family home with his brother inside (driving 1000 miles back from the military school he was at) and nearly got tried as an adult, until Garrett took him under his wing and corrupted him. Christian went on to be a respected senator. Grant kills all three of them in Season 2, though Thomas goes unmentioned. Season 3 finally brings in Thomas, who actually grew up to be a well-adjusted adult and helps S.H.I.E.L.D. lure Grant into a trap.
Agents Of SHIELD	Birds of a Feather	
Agents Of SHIELD	Bitch in Sheep's Clothing	
Agents Of SHIELD	Bittersweet Ending	Featured in many of the first-season episodes, particular as the story arc gets more serious and the Big Bad gets more dangerous. See the individual episode recaps for details.
Agents Of SHIELD	Bizarre Alien Biology	
Agents Of SHIELD	Black-and-Gray Morality	
Agents Of SHIELD	Black-Tie Infiltration	
Agents Of SHIELD	Blade on a Rope	In the episode "Fractured House", the HYDRA member Marcus Scarlotti uses a knife attached to a chain as his main weapon.
Agents Of SHIELD	Bland-Name Product	The logo seen on a delivery truck in the background of the first few minutes of the pilot says "World Parcel Service".
Agents Of SHIELD	Blindfolded Trip	In the pilot, Skye is broadcasting an Internet transmission when Coulson and Ward find her and put a black sack over her head and bring her to their base for interrogation.
Agents Of SHIELD	Bloodier and Gorier	
Agents Of SHIELD	Bloodless Carnage	
Agents Of SHIELD	Body Horror	
Agents Of SHIELD	Bookends	
Agents Of SHIELD	Borrowed Catchphrase	After Fitz plays with spy gadgets from decades ago and burns the curtains, May sarcastically says, "Watch out HYDRA, here we come." This is a minor variation of the Battle Cry of The Invaders.
Agents Of SHIELD	Born After the End	In season 5, we learn of Deke Shaw, a man born a few decades after the destruction of Earth in an alternate timeline, who would be either first or second generation of "earthless human" so to speak.
Agents Of SHIELD	Brains Versus Brawn	The team is roughly split between "brawny" field-experienced agents and the "brainy" techies. Team leader Coulson is arguably the one with equal amounts of both, while Skye is a tech training to become an agent. Season 2 introduces Mack, who's a brain but with the physique and capabilities of being brawn, and Bobbi, who's a brawn but is smart enough to cross into brain.
Agents Of SHIELD	Break the Badass	Melinda May doesn't just get knocked down a peg or two, she ends up on the floor in "Turn, Turn, Turn" after Coulson discovers that she's been spying on him.
Agents Of SHIELD	Break the Cutie	
Agents Of SHIELD	Breaking the Fellowship	
Agents Of SHIELD	Brick Joke	
Agents Of SHIELD	Broken Aesop	Early in Season 7 Deke's decision not to kill Wilfred Malick before he had commited any crimes is presented as a right and noble decision. Subsequent events of the Season show the dire consequences that followed from it, causing both Deke himself and the audience to wish that he had pulled the trigger when he had the chance.
Agents Of SHIELD	Broken Pedestal	
Agents Of SHIELD	Buffy Speak	
Agents Of SHIELD	But for Me, It Was Tuesday	When Coulson meets the big villain of season 4, he learns the man's obsession with him is partly fueled due to the events of a mission Coulson went on early in his career. While Coulson does have some memories of the mission, he has no idea who the guy himself is, or even what the object was they went there for, which his comrades were tortured and executed for failing to protect.Coulson: As far as I'm concerned, you're just another Red Shirt, like so many others who tried to stop me from saving the world. So, cool original story, bro. But this means nothing to me.
Agents Of SHIELD	Butterfly of Doom	The reason the Framework is a Crapsack World — each of the five prisoners was calmed enough to accept it with a Cosmic Retcon of "their greatest regret" — which had world-shattering consequences;
Agents Of SHIELD	Call-Back	
Agents Of SHIELD	The Cameo	
Agents Of SHIELD	Came Back Wrong	It's hinted as the first season progresses that Coulson's resurrection is a little more complicated than it appears. It's revealed that a healing serum derived from an alien was used to revive him, but as a consequence he was driven mad by compulsions to reproduce memories of markings transferred genetically through the serum. His memories were wiped to fix the problem, but being exposed to the symbols causes a relapse. Thankfully, figuring out what they mean takes care of that problem.
Agents Of SHIELD	Canon Character All Along	
Agents Of SHIELD	Canon Foreigner	Most of the main cast are this, at least at first. Averted by Skye, who turns out to be Quake.
Agents Of SHIELD	Canon Immigrant	Coulson made his first appearance in Earth-616 (the mainstream Marvel Universe of the original comics, as opposed to the Marvel Cinematic Universe) in the 2012 series Battle Scars. The S.H.I.E.L.D. comic book series introduced 616 versions of May, Simmons and Fitz — there's no mention of Ward, and Skye is technically is already in 616, even before the show started. Ward eventually did make the jump to the comics, but since this happened long after he was revealed to be a HYDRA agent on the show, he was introduced as a baddie right from the start.
Agents Of SHIELD	Casual Danger Dialogue	Lots of it, apropos for both a Joss Whedon production and the highly-trained S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives themselves.
Agents Of SHIELD	Catching Up on History	After returning from his imprisonment on another world, Hive is taken in by Gideon Malick. While he does know about modern society through the memories of his hosts, Hive still decides to research humanity on his own through multiple screens playing news broadcasts.
Agents Of SHIELD	Cavalry Betrayal	Variant. Ward figures that he and Fitz are on the wrong side of this in "The Hub", after realising that there's no extraction team and that S.H.I.E.L.D. will level the camp once the MacGuffin is disarmed. They both decide to go out fighting. Then Agent May (who is known within S.H.I.E.L.D. as 'The Cavalry') shows up in the Bus with the rest of the team.
Agents Of SHIELD	Ceiling Corpse	This is how Skye discovers Eric Koenig's body and realizes that Ward is a traitor; the latter stashed the body on the ceiling and it dripped on her.
Agents Of SHIELD	Celebrity Paradox	
Agents Of SHIELD	Cerebus Syndrome	
Agents Of SHIELD	Cerebus Retcon	Towards the end of the first season, it's a Running Gag the way everyone quickly realizes that The Clairvoyant had gone insane from the alien blood used to restore his dying body. Come the second second, this is played dead serious since Coulson had also been given the blood and his biggest fear is that he too will lose his mind.
Agents Of SHIELD	Character Catchphrase	
Agents Of SHIELD	Chekhov's Boomerang	
Agents Of SHIELD	Chekhov's Gag	In "Eye-Spy", Ward mentions to Coulson that Skye is having trouble telling a gun's safety from the magazine release. Later in the episode, Skye goes to ready her pistol... and promptly ejects the magazine instead.
Agents Of SHIELD	Chekhov's Gun	
Agents Of SHIELD	Chekhov's Skill	
Agents Of SHIELD	Civil War	
Agents Of SHIELD	Classified Information	It's S.H.I.E.L.D.. Dealing with classified information is just their thing. This is somewhat relaxed on the Bus which means that Skye becomes very frustrated at the levels of security in the Hub. She also makes a joke about it with Miles. But we can't tell it to you unless you are a Troper Level 8. How do you become a level 8? Sorry, that's classified.
Agents Of SHIELD	Code Name	This is discussed between Raina and Chan in "Girl in the Flower Dress". Raina argues that it's important for Chan to use a superhero alias ("Scorch"), since nobody knows who Steve Rogers is, but everyone knows Captain America.
Agents Of SHIELD	Co-Dragons	The Mole and Deathlok are this to the Clairvoyant because they are his personal enforcers instead of grunts like the mass produced super soldiers.
Agents Of SHIELD	Coffin Contraband	Director Fury hid the data from Project T.A.H.I.T.I. in Phil Coulson's unoccupied grave.
Agents Of SHIELD	Color Motif	A few, particularly later in the series.
Agents Of SHIELD	Combat Pragmatist	
Agents Of SHIELD	Comic-Book Movies Don't Use Codenames	With most of the major characters, this trope doesn't apply: they are either adaptions of comic book characters with no Secret Identity (Hill, Hand, Talbot, Fury), or complete Canon Foreigners (the main cast, Coulson included). With characters who do have a codename in the comics, this trope is usually played straight, but sometimes also averted.
Agents Of SHIELD	Commuting on a Bus	The season 4 finale hints that this will be Ghost Rider's role if he returns in season 5, as he clearly does not fit into S.H.I.E.L.D's organizational structure, what with being a vigilante and having to fight hell's battles and all, but will likely lend a hand when necessary.
Agents Of SHIELD	Complexity Addiction	The Kree and their temple and their Diviner and the complicated sliding doors... Really all completely unnecessary. Judging by Ronan and Korath, though, they're a people given to drama.
Agents Of SHIELD	Compliment Backfire	
Agents Of SHIELD	Composite Character	
Agents Of SHIELD	Conflict Ball	
Agents Of SHIELD	Consulting a Convicted Killer	As the Season 2 premiere shows, Ward is being kept in a secure cell in the playground, and Skye consults him on HYDRA-related intel.
Agents Of SHIELD	Contamination Situation	In "FZZT", Simmons is infected with a virus carried by Loki's soldiers that will eventually cause her to explode, taking the entire plane (and all the other characters) down with her. After apparently failing to develop an anti-serum, she jumps from the plane, in what is intended to be a Heroic Sacrifice.
Agents Of SHIELD	Continuity Nod	Has its own page.
Agents Of SHIELD	Continuity Snarl	Season 6 is set after Avengers: Infinity War, but the story proceeds as if the Snap never happened, in spite of the massive societal upheaval it brought. No explanation is given in that season, although the writers of the series have suggested that there is one that they may or may not reveal in Season 7. (The out-of-story reasoning for not acknowledging the ending of the film is because Avengers: Endgame had not yet been released, and the writers and producers decided that it was more important to tell a story that serviced the characters rather than shooting in the dark in the hopes that they'd line up with the movies.)
Agents Of SHIELD	Conveniently Interrupted Document	Skye's search for her birth parents turned up a heavily redacted document that indicates that the person who turned her over to the child welfare system when she was an infant was an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Skye joins S.H.I.E.L.D. in an effort to get access to the unredacted document.
Agents Of SHIELD	Cool Car	Lola, Coulson's 1962 C1 series Corvette convertible. She's outfitted with Stark hover tech and is weaponized.
Agents Of SHIELD	Cool Plane	
Agents Of SHIELD	CPR: Clean, Pretty, Reliable	Simultaneously played with, played straight, and averted in "The Well", when Coulson performs open-heart massage on a fallen Asgardian. Played with; given the faster healing rate of the Asgardian heart, all he has to do is keep it pumping for a few moments until it can repair itself. Played straight; the patient is walking around by the end of the episode. Averted; Coulson ended up bloody to the wrists—it wasn't pretty.
Agents Of SHIELD	Crapsack World	The Framework, as a result of Aida being Literal-Minded. She was told to erase one regret for each person that entered it. Instead of removing the circumstances that caused that regret, they made different decisions in the same exact scenarios. May not killing the Inhuman girl in Bahrain resulted in her using her powers to kill even more people. This caused even more widespread hatred of Inhumans and allowed HYDRA to seize control.
Agents Of SHIELD	Crazy-Prepared	
Agents Of SHIELD	Creator Cameo	Stan Lee in "T.R.A.C.K.S."
Agents Of SHIELD	Cruel and Unusual Death	
Agents Of SHIELD	Crying Wolf	Happens to Raina in "Scars". She's granted a vision of Afterlife being destroyed by S.H.I.E.L.D. following a disastrous meeting between Jiaying and a S.H.I.E.L.D. representative. When she attempts to warn Gordon, she suggests she attend the meeting in Jiaying's place in an attempt to subvert the vision, but after both Skye and Cal vouch for Raina's Manipulative Bitch tendencies he assumes she's trying to usurp power from Jiaying and has her imprisoned. Unfortunately Raina was actually telling the truth this time. Jiaying goes to the meeting and single-handedly starts a war between S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Inhumans by murdering Gonzales and then shooting herself to pretend it was in self defense.
Agents Of SHIELD	Curb-Stomp Cushion	
Agents Of SHIELD	Danger Takes a Backseat	Coulson with the doctor in The Stinger of "The Magical Place". Given the circumstances, the doctor looks like he expects to be killed, and is quite relieved when Coulson has gone and he is still alive.
Agents Of SHIELD	Dare to Be Badass	Coulson gives Daisy one of these when she's reluctant to face Graviton!Talbot alone.Coulson: Now you find the strength in your heart to appeal to his good nature. And if you can't, then you find the strength in your arms to beat his ass senseless.
Agents Of SHIELD	Dark and Troubled Past	Most of the team.
Agents Of SHIELD	Darker and Edgier	
Agents Of SHIELD	Dark Lord on Life Support	Played with:
Agents Of SHIELD	A Day in the Limelight	Although the series is an ensemble theme, every character has had at least one episode devoted to letting them stand out in some way.
Agents Of SHIELD	Deadly Euphemism	"Crossing off" is S.H.I.E.L.D.'s favored terminology. This term is used in "The Team" and the same episode also averts the trope by having Mack directly use the word "kill" to describe what S.H.I.E.L.D. agents occasionally have to do.
Agents Of SHIELD	Deadpan Snarker	This being a Joss Whedon production, it's more like World of Snark, but special mention goes to Coulson because he snarks at the team just like he did with the Avengers.
Agents Of SHIELD	Death by Irony	
Agents Of SHIELD	Death Is Cheap	Phil Coulson simply will not stay dead. The series even kicks off by revealing S.H.I.E.L.D. found a way to bring him back after the events of The Avengers, and while at first it's played with grave seriousness as they brought him back using a Dangerous Forbidden Technique that had lasting negative consequences, it becomes easier and easier for him to come back with each death as the series goes on, be it as a sort-of-but-not-really alternate universe clone or as an advanced cyborg. He outright taunts a villain at one point, claiming that "dying is kind of [his] superpower" before blowing himself and their ship up with a bomb (and yes, he comes back), and in the Series Finale he brags about how many times he cheated death: Coulson: Look, if this is a contest, I died like seven times.
Agents Of SHIELD	Death World	The planet the Kree Monolith sends people to once supported an advance civilization, but by the time of the series it's a barren wasteland of a desert, with the strong implication that Hive himself is responsible for this. The planet is eventually named "Maveth", which is Hebrew for "Death".
Agents Of SHIELD	Deconstructed Character Archetype	This article makes a case for Grant Ward serving as a deconstruction of a particular type of Anti-Hero, by showing that the pain of his past life does not justify him taking it out on others and making it clear that everything is not about him. Since the end of season two, he's also a deconstruction of both Yandere (his revenge for Agent 33's death is really more about him) and Stalker with a Crush.
Agents Of SHIELD	Defrosting Ice Queen	May seems to be becoming one, based on the ending of "Repairs" when she plays a prank on Fitz. She used to do that kind of thing much more, until being traumatized by field work.
Agents Of SHIELD	Determinator	Never tell Coulson "there's no way."
Agents Of SHIELD	Deuteragonist	Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is considered Couslon's show, but Daisy's story is important and drove the plot and Driving Question for a season and a half. A case could be made for May and Ward splitting tritagonist duties.
Agents Of SHIELD	Did You Just Punch Out Cthulhu?	Fitz, of all people, in Season 3, Episode 10, "Maveth." He kills the Hive-possessed Will with a flare gun. In Hive's defense, Worf Had the Flu.
Agents Of SHIELD	Differently Powered Individual	The series uses the term "Gifted" to refer to those with powers, presumably because FOX has the rights to nearly all of the mutants and the word "mutant". It's used as a blanket term for any form of enhanced human, regardless of the source. In "One of Us", Simmons suggests expanding the definition to differentiate between those with artificial enhancements and those whose powers are genetic. By season three, "inhuman" is also used and for all intents and purposes means the same as "mutant".
Agents Of SHIELD	Disc-One Final Boss	The series has a habit of doing this Once a Season.
Agents Of SHIELD	Distracted by the Sexy	Simmons can't seem to keep her eyes, or hands, off Mike in "The Bridge". He's been working out and she likes it.
Agents Of SHIELD	The Dividual	Fitz and Simmons spend so much time together that they're referred to as "Fitz-Simmons" and it's joked that not everyone knows which is which.
Agents Of SHIELD	Doctor von Turncoat	After being captured by Peggy Carter and the S.S.R., Dr. Wener Reinhardt tries to make a deal for his freedom in exchange for his research and assistance, noting that many Nazi scientists (including Hydra members) were offered the same. However, his vivisection experiments are so horrifying that it's too much for the S.S.R. to overlook, so he remains sentenced to life imprisonment.
Agents Of SHIELD	Does Not Like Guns	Discussed with May and Ward when Fitz introduces the ICERs. When May picks one up, Ward remarks that he thought she didn't like guns; May says she only uses them when she needs them, and they seemed like a perfect fit for that particular mission.
Agents Of SHIELD	Does This Remind You of Anything?	
Agents Of SHIELD	Double Standard: Abuse, Female on Male	
Agents Of SHIELD	Double Standard: Rape, Female on Male	
Agents Of SHIELD	Downer Beginning	The Season 5 premiere sends the entire time (except for Fitz) to a Bad Future where humanity is nearly extinct after some cataclysm destroyed the planet multiple generations prior. Deke even goes as far as to say Daisy is responsible for the cataclysm, which everyone initially refutes until Voss confirms several episodes later that during the event, Daisy was in Chicago, the epicenter of the cataclysm - a 12.8 earthquake on the Richter scale, to be exact.
Agents Of SHIELD	Downer Ending	
Agents Of SHIELD	Five-Second Foreshadowing	In the Season 5 finale, the twist that due to temporal shenanigans, the team has realized there's still a version of Fitz alive is hinted at by the team conspicuously not mentioning his name during a memorial that seems to be for him.
Agents Of SHIELD	Dragon with an Agenda	The entire Centipede faction could be considered one to HYDRA, as its primary purpose is to save Garrett's life. Once that finally happens, Garrett states his desire to overthrow HYDRA and rule the world on his own. By contrast, the HYDRA faction in season 2 seems far closer to the interpretation seen in the Captain America films, though it is possible this could change.
Agents Of SHIELD	The Dreaded	
Agents Of SHIELD	Driving Question	
Agents Of SHIELD	Drunk on the Dark Side	
Agents Of SHIELD	Dull Surprise	
Agents Of SHIELD	Early-Installment Weirdness	
Agents Of SHIELD	Emerging from the Shadows	Wait a minute, Coulson is dead, it's in the report, he died before the battle of New York. Cue for Coulson to step out of the dark and clarify that the Reports of His Death Were Greatly Exaggerated.Coulson: Sorry, that corner was really dark, and I couldn't help myself. [Beat] I think there's a bulb out.
Agents Of SHIELD	Empowered Badass Normal	Ward and May each get their turn swinging the Berserker staff in "The Well".
Agents Of SHIELD	Enfant Terrible	The episode "Melinda" has a "gifted" who turns out to be a young girl who "leeches" emotions, and can Mind Rape anyone she touches, turning them into thralls. She is also completely insane.
Agents Of SHIELD	Entertainingly Wrong	
Agents Of SHIELD	Episode on a Plane	"Repairs" is Demons on a Plane.
Agents Of SHIELD	Equal-Opportunity Evil	The modern-day version of HYDRA is shown to be multiracial and its members generally do not consider themselves Nazis.
Agents Of SHIELD	"Eureka!" Moment	
Agents Of SHIELD	Even Evil Has Loved Ones	
Agents Of SHIELD	Even Evil Has Standards	
Agents Of SHIELD	Every Car Is a Pinto	In "0-8-4," the cars are extremely combustible once the rebels attack; shooting a Chevrolet pickup through the rear window will cause it to detonate.
Agents Of SHIELD	Everything Is Online	In "Girl in the Flower Dress", Miles can use his computer to control traffic lights and all the doors in a building. Globally the trope is played straight, but in a less unrealistic way than usual. Skye can hack absolutely anything, from NSA satellite systems to security doors in a building, but in some cases (The Extremis lab in episode 5, Quinn's estate, the Hub communication panel) she has to physically get into the facility to access the local network. So everything is online, but at least not everything is directly accessible through the Internet.
Agents Of SHIELD	Everyone Can See It	
Agents Of SHIELD	Everyone's Baby Sister	Fitz and Simmons both qualify as this trope. The other characters' reactions to their lives being endangered in "FZZT" and "Beginning of the End" exceed what we've learned to expect when Coulson, May, Ward, and Skye risk their lives. Fitz and Simmons are the non-field agents on the team, and two of the youngest next to Daisy. In "FZZT":May: [about Simmons] She's only a kid.
Agents Of SHIELD	Evil All Along	As of "Turn, Turn, Turn", the large number of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who were actually members of HYDRA, including Garrett and Ward.
Agents Of SHIELD	Evil Cripple	"The End of the Beginning" introduces Thomas Nash, who Coulson and Garrett believe to be The Clairvoyant. When they raid his headquarters, he never moves and only communicates through a speech synthesizer. In the end, he is a subversion. He was really catatonic and not controlling the synthesizer at all, and the real Clairvoyant goaded Ward into shooting Nash in the hopes that people would believe the Clairvoyant to be dead.
Agents Of SHIELD	Evil Evolves	The Centipede organization is constantly improving their technology, most of which appears to be originally stolen from other sources. The Centipede device itself is an excellent example.
Agents Of SHIELD	Evil Power Vacuum	HYDRA is like this.
Agents Of SHIELD	Eviler than Thou	Raina is one of the primary villains of Season 1, and always keeps a calm demeanor, even when things are collapsing around her. Then comes Season 2, whose main antagonists — Daniel Whitehall and Cal — both absolutely terrify her.
Agents Of SHIELD	Exact Words	
Agents Of SHIELD	Explosive Leash	Several characters are fitted with bionic eyes that provide x-ray vision and HUD instructions — and explode to instantly kill the subject if they disobey.
Agents Of SHIELD	Expy	
Agents Of SHIELD	Eyeless Face	Gordon, one of the Inhumans of Afterlife, as a result of terrigenesis.
Agents Of SHIELD	Eye Scream	
Agents Of SHIELD	Face Death with Dignity	
Agents Of SHIELD	Face–Heel Turn	The show has many ways in which to turn a good character evil, be it through brainwashing (numerous agents such as Agent 33/Kara), Explosive Leash (Deathlok for a while) or Evil All Along (Ward). It's also pulled a fast one from time to time, most notably with Simmons.
Agents Of SHIELD	Facial Dialogue	Half of one, as Coulson speaks, and May doesn't but he reacts like she's been answering him the whole time.
Agents Of SHIELD	Fake Guest Star	
Agents Of SHIELD	Fake Nationality	In-Universe: Fitz and Skye pose as a couple while on a mission, so Fitz suggests that they should pretend to be the same nationality. After hearing Skye's terrible Scottish accent, he decides to adopt an American accent instead.
Agents Of SHIELD	Fake Shemp	Nick Fury and Maria Hill make a "cameo" during a Flashback in "The Magical Place", but are only shown from a distance and have their faces obscured.
Agents Of SHIELD	Fake Static	
Agents Of SHIELD	Faked Kidnapping	In "The Asset": Dr. Hall set up his own kidnapping once he knew that Quinn needed him in order to take him down, but S.H.I.E.L.D. had no idea he did this and Quinn himself thinks the whole thing was his idea.
Agents Of SHIELD	False Flag Operation	In "A Fractured House", HYDRA mercenaries attack the United Nations while impersonating S.H.I.E.L.D., in order to turn the world's militaries against them. Talbot sees through that from the start, as he notes to Senator Ward.
Agents Of SHIELD	Fantastic Medicinal Bodily Product	"T.A.H.I.T.I." reveals that agent Coulson was resurrected by a drug called GH.325, derived from the bodily fluids of a blue humanoid corpse of unknown origin, code named G.H. It is then used to heal Skye's fatal bullet wounds.
Agents Of SHIELD	Fantastic Racism	A subplot in Season 2 and continuing from there.
Agents Of SHIELD	Faux Affably Evil	
Agents Of SHIELD	Fingore	Kara and Ward's torture of Bobbi at the end of Season 2 includes shoving pieces of wire under her fingernails.
Agents Of SHIELD	Fire-Forged Friends	The team begins this process in "0-8-4", to a greater or lesser extent depending on which characters.
Agents Of SHIELD	First-Episode Twist	
Agents Of SHIELD	Flat-Earth Atheist	In "Eye Spy", people point out that science hasn't confirmed the validity of psychic powers. This being in a universe filled with Norse gods, aliens, and gamma radiation monsters. Skye points out the absurdity of this.
Agents Of SHIELD	Fleeting Demographic Rule	Three years after SHIELDRA came within milliseconds of executing every threat on the planet to HYDRA's One World Order with drone strikes, conspiracy theorists are again a kooky minority; in "Hot Potato Soup", the fourth Koenig brother, Thurston, is a slam poet activist at a beatnik bar with no clientele.
Agents Of SHIELD	Flock of Wolves	Coulson has a serious mole problem:
Agents Of SHIELD	Flying Car	Lola, which makes for the difference between "new" and "improved".
Agents Of SHIELD	Food Porn	Fitz describing his sandwich in "The Hub" certainly qualifies. No wonder he gets mad once Ward throws it away.
Agents Of SHIELD	Foreshadowing	Has its own page.
Agents Of SHIELD	Former Regime Personnel	This becomes a problem in season 2. With the dissolution of S.H.I.E.L.D., a large number of highly trained people were out of work and seeking new opportunities. Most went into the private sector or were hired by various US government agencies. Some went underground like Team Coulson in order to continue with their mission. However, many took whatever intelligence and/or secret technology they had and sold it to the highest bidder. In the worst cases, some were recruited willingly or unwillingly by HYDRA.
Agents Of SHIELD	Four Is Death	Subtly used in the episode, "The Only Light in the Darkness." The group in total ends up splitting up into two groups of four, and while Coulson's group ends up okay, back at Providence May leaves, and Eric is killed by Ward leading Skye to the realization that Ward is a HYDRA agent.
Agents Of SHIELD	The Fourth Wall Will Not Protect You	At the end of "Turn, Turn, Turn", when S.H.I.E.L.D. has been overtaken by HYDRA, the normal closing screen of the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo is replaced with that of HYDRA.
Agents Of SHIELD	Freudian Excuse Is No Excuse	Even before being revealed to be evil, Ward's tragic past as a victim of abuse (from both his parents and elder brother) was referenced more than once. He is eventually outed as a bad guy towards the end of season one and remains Team Coulson's most persistent and reoccurring enemy through the next season-and-a-half. Despite this, he likes to constantly tell others (and himself) that his actions are either not his fault or are completely justified due to his terrible childhood, but the other main characters constantly make it a point to call him out on his actions and even say that in his anger towards his family, he's become something worse than them.
Agents Of SHIELD	Freudian Slip	Fitz has one while talking to Skye in the pilot.Fitz: So, uh, when you get back, I'll show you my thing. Uh, thing, it's not...it's my hardware. My equipment! [to himself] Hang up...
Agents Of SHIELD	Funny Background Event	
Agents Of SHIELD	Fun with Acronyms	
Agents Of SHIELD	Gainax Ending	"Ascension" wraps up the plot that the season was building towards. Then, instead of going with a denouement, the episode has a Smash Cut establishing a Time Skip serving as a Sequel Hook, leaving a lot more questions than answers.
Agents Of SHIELD	Gaining the Will to Kill	FitzSimmons do this while remaining the Non-Action Pair. In the first season everyone was surprised whenever either one took slightly violent action, fast forward to season 4 where both regularly carry guns and simultaneously shoot a Mook without hesitation.
Agents Of SHIELD	Gambit Pileup	By the end of "The End of the Beginning", it's clear that there are no less than three factions within S.H.I.E.L.D., each with its own agenda. There's the main team, led by Agent Coulson; an unnamed group trying to keep the details of Coulson's resurrection a secret from Coulson and everybody else; and a more villainous faction who answers to the Clairvoyant (revealed to all be HYDRA moles).
Agents Of SHIELD	Gender-Equal Ensemble	
Agents Of SHIELD	Generation Xerox	an odd but justified example, given how Hydra is most recently influenced by the example of Red Skull, the successful Hydra heads (that is, long-lasting season Big Bads) are mostly such as Garret, Whitehall, and Malick are the ones who head science division.
Agents Of SHIELD	Geniuses Have Multiple PhDs	Both Fitz and Simmons are introduced as 20something geniuses — him, mechanical, and her, biological — with multiple PhDs apiece. According to "Making Friends and Influencing People" Simmons had obtained her two PhDs by seventeen.
Agents Of SHIELD	Genre Savvy	
Agents Of SHIELD	Genre Shift	Season 4 shifts away from pure Science Fiction to include supernatural elements like Ghost Rider, who is explicitly not Inhuman. This coincides with the introduction of supernatural heroes in the Phase Three films, Doctor Strange being the standout example (though Black Panther likewise has a supernatural element).
Agents Of SHIELD	The Gods Must Be Lazy	In "The Well" Coulson complains about the apparent lack of the Norse god of "cleaning up after yourself" while dealing with the aftermath of Thor: The Dark World's climax in London.
Agents Of SHIELD	Good Is Not Nice	Although S.H.I.E.L.D. are the good guys, it is occasionally hinted at that the organization engages in activities such as assassinations. This is confirmed in the second season, when we're told that "hostile gifted individuals"note people with superpowers are sometimes crossed off the Index. We also later see a S.H.I.E.L.D. assassin from the "dark side" of the organization.
Agents Of SHIELD	Good Is Not Soft	Several characters fit the specifics of this trope such as Coulson. Daisy and Bobbi Morse. In particular with Daisy, the series follows her character arc from being a meek and mild hacker to her first kill to being able to kill a room full of mooks without breaking a sweat.
Agents Of SHIELD	Gory Discretion Shot	At the beginning of "The Ghost," a group of white supremacists are massacred by Ghost Rider. One of the skinheads is dragged off-screen, and all the audiences sees is a large amount of blood splattering against the side of his vehicle after a short bout of screaming. A later conversation between Mack and Coulson reveals that Ghost Rider ripped out the skinhead's spine. Apparently, through his ass.
Agents Of SHIELD	G-Rated Drug	Creel/Absorbing Man "enjoys" the feeling he gets when absorbing the properties of other materials into his body, as demonstrated when he turns into wood purely for recreational purposes. His handler even pays him with rare materials.
Agents Of SHIELD	Gratuitous Foreign Language	
Agents Of SHIELD	Gravity Screw	When Dr. Hall puts the graviton device on full power, gravity in the compound starts going every which-way.
Agents Of SHIELD	Let's You and Him Fight	In "Failed Experiments", May decides to allow Hive and a Kree Hunter to fight to the death, with the intention that the Kree Hunter would win and kill Hive. Unfortunately, Hive wins.
Agents Of SHIELD	Greater-Scope Villain	As of "Turn, Turn, Turn": It's revealed that Garrett is The Clairvoyant and works for HYDRA, but he's never been seen taking orders from anyone, and Alexander Pierce is The Ghost. Regardless of how much control Pierce or HYDRA as a whole has over Garrett, Garrett's still functionally the series Big Bad for that season.
Agents Of SHIELD	Green Aesop	A subtle one in "The Asset": Quinn is implied to use ecologically short-sighted methods like strip-mining to make a profit, but it's not the focus of the episode, and in the end, Dr. Hall is the one who nearly kills everyone.
Agents Of SHIELD	Grief-Induced Split	Mack's daughter Hope died four days after her birth, which caused him and his wife to divorce. Though he's been able to grieve and move forward, he still feels the loss keenly enough for the Spirit of Vengeance to possess and suppress him.
Agents Of SHIELD	The Guards Must Be Crazy	Averted when Ward tries to talk his way into a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility. No matter what he says or does, even the usual 'call their superiors' trick, they absolutely refuse to let him in and invite him to call up the chain of command. He does eventually get them to let him in, but he needs a helicopter shooting at him to do so.
Agents Of SHIELD	Guest-Star Party Member	
Agents Of SHIELD	Hacker Collective	When she first appears, Skye is a member of a hacker society called "Rising Tide". This society suffered from Chuck Cunningham Syndrome from the second season onwards.
Agents Of SHIELD	The Heavy	Raina, member of Centipede, tends to be the face of the organization from an audience perspective, given their tendency to let their own members die. Even Raina recognizes that her superiors don't give a crap about her well-being.
Agents Of SHIELD	Heel Realization	Coulson talks a murderous, superpowered, pissed-off Mr Hyde on a rampage through SHIELD headquarters into one in the season 2 finale, convincing him that his wife is beyond redemption and he should help stop them.
Agents Of SHIELD	Helmets Are Hardly Heroic	It's a recurring thing in the series that while random agents usually wear combat armor complete with helmets, the main characters wear leather jumpsuits or just a t-shirt (or in Coulson's case a suit and tie).
Agents Of SHIELD	Heroic BSoD	
Agents Of SHIELD	Heroic Sacrifice	
Agents Of SHIELD	Hero's First Rescue	In the premiere, Mike Peterson's heroic debut was climbing up the side of a burning building to rescue a woman trapped in the top floor.
Agents Of SHIELD	Hero of Another Story	The Avengers are often mentioned as the Big Good, but they never appear in the series (unless you count Fury as an Avenger).
Agents Of SHIELD	He's Back!	
Agents Of SHIELD	Hidden Agenda Villain	For much of the first season it was unknown what Centipede's end goals were. They are creating super-soldiers, but why? "Providence" eventually gives an answer: Garrett's conversation with Raina suggests the group was founded by HYDRA and recruited with promises of "changing the world", meaning they've always been pawns in HYDRA's goals. "Ragtag" makes it even more clear: John Garrett is being kept alive by first-generation Deathlok technology, which is failing. He wants the Centipede tech to replace it and the GH-325 drug is the last element.
Agents Of SHIELD	Hidden Elf Village	The Inhuman city of Lai Shi doesn't take kindly to outsiders. Even its inhabitants don't know where exactly the city is.
Agents Of SHIELD	Hidden in Plain Sight	An ancient Asgardian citizen has been living in hiding on Earth for centuries and is currently the foremost expert on Norse language and mythology.
Agents Of SHIELD	Hide Your Gays	
Agents Of SHIELD	High-Altitude Interrogation	A variant: During an interrogation, Ward straps himself to his chair while Fitz/Simmons open the ceiling, threatening to pull someone out via the difference in air pressure.
Agents Of SHIELD	High-Dive Escape	In "The Asset", Skye escapes from Quinn's mansion by leaping off the balcony into the swimming pool.
Agents Of SHIELD	Hijacked by Ganon	The identity of the Clairvoyant is revealed in "Turn, Turn, Turn". However, mere seconds later, it's also revealed he wasn't just working towards his own ends, but also for HYDRA, albeit, he's mostly using HYDRA's resources for his goals. HYDRA continues to be a major antagonistic presence throughout the next four seasons, led by Daniel Whitehall, Ward, Gideon Malick, Aida (in an alternate reality version of HYDRA) and General Hale.
Agents Of SHIELD	History Repeats	More than a few times.
Agents Of SHIELD	Hitler Ate Sugar	Invoked by Daisy in "Absolution".Coulson: You were brainwashed!Daisy: So was Ward.
Agents Of SHIELD	Hoist by His Own Petard	
Agents Of SHIELD	Hollywood Board Games	
Agents Of SHIELD	Hollywood Encryption	Skye's hard drive can only be decrypted at a specific geographic location.
Agents Of SHIELD	Hollywood Hacking	Regularly when Skye's hacking skills are involved. Hacking the NSA satellite streams? No problem, it shouldn't take more than one hour.
Agents Of SHIELD	Hollywood Mid-Life Crisis	Cammila Reyes, Coulson's New Old Flame, suggests he's going through this in "0-8-4." Coulson suggests it's more of an afterlife crisis.
Agents Of SHIELD	Homage	
Agents Of SHIELD	Honesty Is the Best Policy	
Agents Of SHIELD	Hope Spot	
Agents Of SHIELD	Hostage for MacGuffin	In "The Bridge", Centipede kidnaps Mike's son and offers him up in exchange for Mike... until it turns out they actually want Coulson.
Agents Of SHIELD	Humans Are the Real Monsters	
Agents Of SHIELD	Human Weapon	Akela in "Eye Spy". She is controlled by people who implanted her with a cybernetic eye which can see through walls, transmit video streams, display messages, ... and monitor everything she does, and explodes should she run away or get caught. The ending reveals that her controller is also a pawn who got the exact same treatment. Then, in "A Magical Place", we see the technology again used on Deathlok and some enemy soldiers.
Agents Of SHIELD	Hurl It into the Sun	Objects deemed too dangerous to be kept are disposed of via "The Slingshot", a facility where the offending device is stuck in a missile and launched into the sun. "Providence" reveals that the items are actually secretly tucked away in the Fridge, and the missiles are just for show.
Agents Of SHIELD	Hypocritical Humor	FitzSimmons are particularly prone to this.
Agents Of SHIELD	I Call It "Vera"	
Agents Of SHIELD	I Want My Beloved to Be Happy	
Agents Of SHIELD	An Ice Person	Donnie Gill, aka Blizzard.
Agents Of SHIELD	Idiot Ball	
Agents Of SHIELD	Ignorance Is Bliss	
Agents Of SHIELD	I Have Your Wife	
Agents Of SHIELD	Movie Superheroes Wear Black	
Agents Of SHIELD	Immortal Apathy	Professor Randolph, an Asgardian who's already millennia old, has issues relating to humans who live much shorter lives than he does. For instance, he initially has issues considering people misusing his berserker staff to be a problem because as far as he's concerned they'll all die soon enough anyway, and he tries reassuring Ward about the staff's darker effects by saying it'll wear off in "a few decades."
Agents Of SHIELD	Immortality Field	Life and death have no meanings in the Fear Dimension, therefore nobody can truly die there.
Agents Of SHIELD	Immune to Bullets	
Agents Of SHIELD	I Need A Drink	Coulson's first move after retaking the Bus in "0-8-4" is to the convenient on-board bar. Which Fury, in the stinger, notes that he generously provided.
Agents Of SHIELD	I Never Said It Was Poison	The Clairvoyant's identity is ultimately revealed this way; he knows too much about Raina.
Agents Of SHIELD	Information Wants to Be Free	An early theme in the series is the security vs. privacy debate, as well as the control vs. freedom of information debate. The show mostly comes down in favor of the security and control of information sides, and the message seems to be that it's easy to demand freedom of information when you're not responsible for its consequences.
Agents Of SHIELD	Injured Self-Drag	In season 1, Skye/Daisy gets shot in the stomach twice. She manages to drag herself across the room and open the door, but she's too weak to make it any further. Coulson finds her, barely alive, and yells for the rest of the team.
Agents Of SHIELD	In Medias Res	"0-8-4" opens with the crew on their way back from a mission, Coulson saying that he thinks they've seen the last of the trouble, and an explosion; then it cuts to "19 Hours Earlier". By the time the story gets back to Coulson's remark and the explosion, it's turned out that several things aren't as they first appeared.
Agents Of SHIELD	Inside a Computer System	The Framework works as one during the third arc of Season 4.
Agents Of SHIELD	Insistent Terminology	
Agents Of SHIELD	Inspector Javert	
Agents Of SHIELD	Instant Sedation	The Night-Night gun, as well as its smaller counterpart the Night-Light gun, puts out anyone hit with it immediately.
Agents Of SHIELD	Intangibility	Coulson, Fitz, and Robbie Reyes get trapped between dimensions in the episode "Deals with Our Devils" and are unable to touch people in the "real" world (though they don't fall through the floor, and Reyes is able to touch and travel using a car in the "real" world).
Agents Of SHIELD	Inter-Service Rivalry	There is a school rivalry level one between the various S.H.I.E.L.D. academies. Operations takes pride in how difficult their training is. Science and Technology takes pride in how hard it is to get accepted into their academy in the first place. Both of them look down on the Analysts.
Agents Of SHIELD	I Reject Your Reality	
Agents Of SHIELD	Irony	
Agents Of SHIELD	It Gets Easier	Defied by May:May: [to Skye] For the record, experience doesn't make it any easier to cross someone off.
Agents Of SHIELD	It's Quiet… Too Quiet	Robbie's reaction to an empty hallway during a stakeout in "The Law of Inferno Dynamics" is to point out that it's not really as clear as it looks.
Agents Of SHIELD	Jerkass Has a Point	
Agents Of SHIELD	Just Plane Wrong	
Agents Of SHIELD	Just Shoot Him	
Agents Of SHIELD	Karma Houdini	
Agents Of SHIELD	Karmic Death	
Agents Of SHIELD	Kick the Dog	Quite a few.
Agents Of SHIELD	Kidnapped Scientist	
Agents Of SHIELD	Killed Off for Real	So far, each season has featured Character Deaths that have been rendered permanent
Agents Of SHIELD	Kill It with Fire	
Agents Of SHIELD	Kill Me Now, or Forever Stay Your Hand	The tactic that Gonzales uses with Agent May at the end of "Afterlife", prior to offering her a spot on "real" S.H.I.E.L.D.'s board. She declines to take a shot, claiming that he wouldn't be so stupid as to really hand her a loaded gun. However, it really was loaded after all.
Agents Of SHIELD	Killer Incapacitates Instead	While Centipede holds no qualms about killing anyone who stands in their way, they are willing to spare those who are valuable to their operations in some way. This is purely out of Pragmatic Villainy, and they're fine with terminating their own people if they outlive their usefulness.
Agents Of SHIELD	Kirk Summation	
Agents Of SHIELD	Lampshade Hanging	
Agents Of SHIELD	Lancer vs. Dragon	During the Season 1 finale, Melinda, Coulson's Lancer fights the team's former Lancer Grant Ward, who is revealed to be The Dragon All Along.
Agents Of SHIELD	La Résistance	Skye regards Peruvian anti-mining rebels as this in "0-8-4" when Coulson arrives in the Peruvian countryside, fighting against perceived injustice due to the Peruvian government's willingness to exploit the countryside for natural resources. The Peruvian Army's military police soldiers were perfectly willing to kill the team and blame the rebels (even though they'd rescued them from the rebels and Coulson was their leader's ex-partner, in more ways than one) to get the device (a powerful weapon which they'd commissioned former Nazi/HYDRA scientists to build in the first place).
Agents Of SHIELD	Laser-Guided Karma	In season 1, HYDRA is shown to have infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D., with Garrett, Ward, and Sitwell as confirmed double agents. In season 2, S.H.I.E.L.D. returns the favor, with Simmons among those infiltrating HYDRA.
Agents Of SHIELD	Last-Name Basis	Everyone is referred to by their last name, barring personal moments, with the exception of Skye, who doesn't have a last name.
Agents Of SHIELD	Late-Arrival Spoiler	
Agents Of SHIELD	Leaning on the Fourth Wall	
Agents Of SHIELD	Left Out a Piece	In the ninth episode, Coulson's team is called in to investigate a recent explosion at an experimental energy plant that took the lives of several workers. While the safety supervisor, Hannah, was originally blamed, it's eventually revealed that Tobias (one of the workers believed to be dead) was responsible. He had a crush on Hannah but couldn't get her attention, so he'd loosen bolts on various parts in his section before reporting the safety issue, giving her a reason to come see him. It was him loosening the wrong bolt on the wrong part at the wrong time that caused the explosion.
Agents Of SHIELD	Legacy Character	
Agents Of SHIELD	Legion of Doom	"One of Us" revolves around Skye's father assembling a team of supervillains to take down Coulson's group. The villains in question are all superhumans who were imprisoned or mistreated after ending up in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Index.
Agents Of SHIELD	Mr. Fanservice	
Agents Of SHIELD	Ms. Fanservice	
Agents Of SHIELD	Mugged for Disguise	
Agents Of SHIELD	Like Brother and Sister	Fitz and Simmons, with their constant, comfortable switching between gentle concern and indignant bickering with each other. The basic dynamic even survives Fitz's Love Epiphany towards Simmons mid-Season 1 but not the events of Season 2.
Agents Of SHIELD	Little "No"	
Agents Of SHIELD	Location Subtitles	Every location gets the name of the area, and a quick geostamp describing where it is. Except for S.H.I.E.L.D. facilities, which inevitably get "Location: Classified."
Agents Of SHIELD	Locked Out of the Loop	Due to S.H.I.E.L.D clearence levels certain information is off limits to certain people. Everything about Coulson's death is classified to even the higher up agents except Fury himself. May knew all along, but was ordered to keep it to herself and report to Fury on a secret encrypted line in case Coulson Came Back Wrong. Coulson is furious when he finds out, especially since Fitz found the encrypted line but not what it's for.
Agents Of SHIELD	Lonely Bachelor Pad	Jemma Simmons' apartment during her infiltration of HYDRA is so bare that Coulson decides to risk her cover to buy her groceries.
Agents Of SHIELD	Love Dodecahedron	A rather linear one. From bottom to top: Simmons crushing on Fitz, crushing on Skye, crushing on Ward, crushing on May, crushing on Coulson, crushing on Lola (and also still in love with Audrey). Fitz's crush on Skye only lasts about a week, and then he starts to reciprocate towards Simmons, who by now has attracted the attentions of Triplett, and possibly reciprocates them. Ward and May's relationship is just meaningless sex, and Ward eventually admits feeling for Skye. As of season 4, May's LMD admits to being in love with Coulson, which implies that the original May feels likewise.
Agents Of SHIELD	Lower-Deck Episode	The entire show, from the perspective of the greater Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Agents Of SHIELD	MacGyvering	Fitz builds an anti-weapon blaster out of the pieces of the separatists' Overkill Device in "The Hub".
Agents Of SHIELD	Magical Database	The Index, the list of all known Differently Powered Individuals and "special objects" (re: identified 0-8-4s). It's said to not be a very long list, but given the rate at which these things keep popping up, it will likely grow to be one.
Agents Of SHIELD	Magitek	Devices created from blueprints provided by the Darkhold routinely violate the laws of physics, the implication being that they are powered by magic.
Agents Of SHIELD	The Main Characters Do Everything	In the first season it was because the story was about a small team that was expected to operate independently. Even in later seasons after SHIELD is taken apart and then rebuilt, primary cast members still do fieldwork even though their job titles would imply that they should be spending all their time handling strategic and administrative matters.
Agents Of SHIELD	Mass Super-Empowering Event	Thanks to a crate of terrigen crystals being dumped into the ocean in the season 2 finale, any potential Inhuman who is exposed to nearly anything made from aquatic life has a chance of undergoing terrigenesis. A simulation predicts that the oceans will be totally saturated within 17 months.
Agents Of SHIELD	Match in a Bomb Shack	In one episode, Ghost Rider and Hellfire, both of whom are powerful fire-wielders, fall into a fireworks warehouse during their fight, with Ghost Rider in full Flaming Skull mode, prompting a This Is Gonna Suck moment from Agents Mack and Coulson, who know just what is about to happen. Mack: ...did two fire dudes just drop into a warehouse full of fireworks?Coulson: You had to see that coming.
Agents Of SHIELD	MayIncatec	The Inca temple in "0-8-4" looks like it was built by Mayans, right down to the writing on the inside walls. The Incas didn't even have writing.
Agents Of SHIELD	Meaningful Echo	
Agents Of SHIELD	Mêlée à Trois	Season 2 opens with no less than four factions going up against each other in various combinations: S.H.I.E.L.D., HYDRA, the US Military, and the Inhumans.
Agents Of SHIELD	Memory Gambit	An involuntary one, as revealed in "Nothing Personal": One of Coulson's current drives was to find out who supervised Project T.A.H.I.T.I., since, after The Reveal that S.H.I.E.L.D. was infiltrated by HYDRA, Coulson suspected that HYDRA might have had a hand in resurrecting him and possibly using him as an asset. But then, May manages to get Coulson the file that reveals who supervised the project... and it was Coulson himself, under Nick Fury's orders. T.A.H.I.T.I. was a project designed to resurrect a fallen Avenger if worst came to worst, but Coulson not only recommended cancellation of the project, he even handed his resignation because of it. Coulson revealed that the only apparent way to be able to survive Project T.A.H.I.T.I. sane was through Fake Memories, since the process was so traumatic it'd drive the subject insane. And that's exactly what they did.
Agents Of SHIELD	The Men in Black	The show has a broad B-plot of showcasing the people behind the dark suits and sunglasses. In addition to being a high-level national security outfit, teams like Agent Coulson's operate as Artifact Collection Agents (whether those "artifacts" are inanimate objects or people).
Agents Of SHIELD	Messianic Archetype	Lincoln is this, in the Season 3 finale "Ascension," when he sacrifices himself to take down Hive and ensure that the warhead detonates harmlessly in outer space. The symbolism is abundant, from Lincoln releasing the cross necklace shortly before his death to justifying his sacrifice for what Hive saw as "flawed" creatures by stating that, "They're only human."
Agents Of SHIELD	Mexican Standoff	
Agents Of SHIELD	Mildly Military	
Agents Of SHIELD	Minor Crime Reveals Major Plot	Some average Joe gets Extremis injected into him —> a conspiracy to bring S.H.I.E.L.D. down from within.
Agents Of SHIELD	Mock Headroom	While in the 1980s, spoiler LMD Coulson has his body destroyed, and his consiousness is uploaded in a television. The background of the screen is a near copy of Max Headroom's, Coulson wears a suit, and he speaks glitchily. Coulson directly compares his situation to Max Headroom.
Agents Of SHIELD	The Mole	
Agents Of SHIELD	Moment Killer	
Agents Of SHIELD	Monster of the Week	The non-myth-arc episodes that don't have the agents pursuing a MacGuffin feature a super-powered villain or phenomenon of some kind, at least at first glance. These sometimes prove to be a Bait-and-Switch.
Agents Of SHIELD	Mood Whiplash	
Agents Of SHIELD	Moral Myopia	
Agents Of SHIELD	The Most Wanted	In a What Could Have Been example, the character of Barbara "Bobbi" Morse was famous enough to get her own Spin-Off called Marvel's Most Wanted in 2015, in which she and her ex-husband and partner Lance Hunter get framed and have to quit S.H.I.E.L.D. and stay undercover to find who made them the most wanted by various sides, S.H.I.E.L.D. included. The pilot was ordered, but in the end the possible series was cancelled.
Agents Of SHIELD	Mouth of Sauron	Edison Po serves as the spokesperson for the Clairvoyant. After his death, Raina takes his place.
Agents Of SHIELD	Murder, Inc.	On occasion during Season 2, Coulson appears to be pushing SHIELD in that direction with the targeted assassination of HYDRA leaders. The "reputation building" aspect of the trope also appears to be at least attempted, though not very successfully.
Agents Of SHIELD	My God, What Have I Done?	
Agents Of SHIELD	My Greatest Failure	
Agents Of SHIELD	Myth Arc	A few throughout the series:
Agents Of SHIELD	Mythology Gag	Has its own page.
Agents Of SHIELD	Namesake Institution	In the Framework arc of Season Four, the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents are sent to a virtual reality where HYDRA has taken over the world. Phil Coulson becomes a school teacher who works at the "Alexander Pierce High School", named in honor of HYDRA leader Alexander Pierce.
Agents Of SHIELD	A Nazi by Any Other Name	
Agents Of SHIELD	Nebulous Evil Organization	
Agents Of SHIELD	Neck Snap	In "A Fractured House", Bobbi/Mockingbird snaps a weapon's dealer's neck using a sash. Technically, she hangs him long enough to break his neck.
Agents Of SHIELD	Never Found the Body	
Agents Of SHIELD	Never Trust a Trailer	
Agents Of SHIELD	New Old Flame	
Agents Of SHIELD	Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!	Coulson's team are not immune to making bad calls; in fact, everyone screws up majorly at some point in the series:
Agents Of SHIELD	Nice Job Fixing It, Villain!	
Agents Of SHIELD	Nigh-Invulnerable	
Agents Of SHIELD	No Equal-Opportunity Time Travel	Downplayed but still present in Season 7. It doesn't majorly hinder them (though Mack does get dirty looks for being a black guy im a nice suit in the 30's), except when they have to interrogate a guy from the 50's who's too racist to take Mack, Yo-Yo, or May seriously.
Agents Of SHIELD	No Kill like Overkill	
Agents Of SHIELD	No Party Given	Averted. Senator Christian Ward is identified as a Republican from Massachusetts.
Agents Of SHIELD	No Power, No Color	The Coulson LMD robot is hit with an EMP that disables him and causes his irises to turn grey. Even after he is reactivated, nearly the entire episode is Deliberately Monochrome to show that his color vision has not yet returned (as well as being a Genre Throwback to Film Noir).
Agents Of SHIELD	No Social Skills	
Agents Of SHIELD	Nothing Is the Same Anymore	
Agents Of SHIELD	Noble Bigot	A major problem for S.H.I.E.L.D. is their treatment of gifted people — putting them on an Index in case they ever went rogue and assigning them a handler. While some gifted people are dangergous the majority are just people who want to be left alone and resent being treated like a potential threat/ second class citizen. In addition, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s procedure for gifteds are physcologically demeaning for them. It's why the Inhumans have gone to great lengths to keep themselves hidden — and when S.H.I.E.L.D. finds their hidden sanctuary both sides over react in the worse possible way.
Agents Of SHIELD	Non-Indicative Name	You would think that a place named "The fridge" would be located in Alaska, or some other very cold place. Its location is classified, but when we saw it, it did not appear to be in the arctic at all.
Agents Of SHIELD	Noodle Incident	
Agents Of SHIELD	Not Distracted by the Sexy	In "0-8-4", Coulson instantly recognizes that his old flame Reyes is only coming on to him as part of a plot for her troops to seize the Bus.
Agents Of SHIELD	Not in This for Your Revolution	Despite HYDRA being the primary villains, most of the people working with/for them don't seem to share their beliefs.
Agents Of SHIELD	"Not So Different" Remark	There are several occasions of this happening.
Agents Of SHIELD	Not Using the "Z" Word	The Inhumans in season 2 are never referred to by that name (the closest being when Fitz describes a heartbeat as "inhuman"). Simmons notes that S.H.I.E.L.D.'s current terminology is not sufficient, but doesn't have any better suggestions, and the Inhumans themselves refer to their people as "descendants." In "Scars," Skye finally reveals that "Inhumans" is the official term they use for themselves, and it starts being used regularly.
Agents Of SHIELD	Not Wearing Tights	
Agents Of SHIELD	Obstructive Bureaucrat	
Agents Of SHIELD	Offscreen Afterlife	According to Coulson, the other side is "beautiful". Although it is possible he was just saying this to reassure the doomed fire-fighter in "FZZT" because he knew he was about to die and there was nothing else he could do for him.
Agents Of SHIELD	Oh, Crap!	
Agents Of SHIELD	Ominous Cube	The Toolbox is a tiny cube-shaped database that contains the entirety of SHIELD's files.
Agents Of SHIELD	Omnidisciplinary Scientist	
Agents Of SHIELD	Once a Season	
Agents Of SHIELD	Once Done, Never Forgotten	As demonstrated in "Nothing Personal" and "One Door Closes", HYDRA is having a hard time living down its Nazi origins despite the fact that its original leader, the Red Skull, was never loyal to the Führer, and most of the modern HYDRA are just members of S.H.I.E.L.D. who had fascist leanings. It doesn't help that one of its leaders following the Red Skull's demise was also a member of the Nazi party prior to HYDRA's establishment and served in that position until 2014. Making matters weirder, it turns out HYDRA were never a Nazi off-shoot to begin with, and were instead a much older organisation that were using the Nazis for their own purposes.
Agents Of SHIELD	One-Man Army	
Agents Of SHIELD	One-Steve Limit	In terms of nicknames, at least. Season 1 had a one-shot S.H.I.E.L.D. agent named Mack, the trucker agent, while Season 2 introduces recurring character Alfonso 'Mack' Mackenzie. Mackenzie is from the comics, but he's generally called Al in them.
Agents Of SHIELD	One-Word Title	"Pilot", "0-8-4", "FZZT", "Repairs", "Seeds", "T.R.A.C.K.S.", "T.A.H.I.T.I.", "Providence", "Ragtag", "Shadows", "Aftershocks", "Afterlife", "Melinda", "Scars", "SOS", "Closure", "Maveth", "Watchdogs", "Spacetime", "Emancipation", "Absolution", "Ascension", "Uprising", "Lockup", "BOOM", "Orientation", "Rewind", "Principia", "Inescapable", "Toldja", and "Leap".
Agents Of SHIELD	Only Known by Their Nickname	Skye is a name she gave herself, and she doesn't use her legal name. It's finally revealed in "The Only Light In The Darkness": Mary Sue Poots. No wonder she stopped using it. "What They Become" reveals that the name her parents gave her is Daisy. As of the start of the third season, she goes by "Daisy," which Coulson has trouble remembering sometimes.
Agents Of SHIELD	Only Mostly Dead	Coulson explains that he (just barely) survived Loki's attack in The Avengers. At least, that's what he was told, instead of the traumatizing reality.
Aishiteru	Parental Favoritism	Seiko and Hideaki, but they don't realize it and are genuinely surprised when Mihoko tells them how much she felt neglected.
Agents Of SHIELD	Only One Name	A number of major recurring characters are only known by a single name, including Raina, Gordon, and Jiaying. Interestingly, all three of these characters are killed in the season 2 finale.
Agents Of SHIELD	Order Reborn	A work in progress, after the events of Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Starting from the first season finale, Nick Fury charges Director Coulson and his team with rebuilding S.H.I.E.L.D. from the ground up. By the time of season 4 it's on the verge of becoming an official legal entity again under the supervision of the U.N.
Agents Of SHIELD	Out-Gambitted	Happens to Raina when she tries to blackmail Coulson by threatening to blow Simmons' cover as a mole within HYDRA if he didn't turn over Skye. What Raina didn't know is that Coulson had another agent within HYDRA, Bobbi Morse, whose explicit job was to protect Simmons should she need it.
Agents Of SHIELD	Outside-Context Problem	While this is a version of the Marvel Universe and magic and the supernatural were bound to show up, members of SHIELD haven't really encountered anything truly supernatural (except for the Asgardians, who are more like Magitek). Season 4 introduces them to both the Hero and Villain sides of this trope.
Agents Of SHIELD	Overt Operative	For a top secret organization, our heroes sure have a lot of S.H.I.E.L.D. logos and big black eagle emblems on their vehicles. There is even a S.H.I.E.L.D. SUV decked out with police equipment (flashers and ram bar). In "The Asset", S.H.I.E.L.D. is described as an international agency along with the United States and Europe, so in the MCU, they may be the equivalent to Interpol. The logos disappear after the events of "Turn, Turn, Turn", as the agency goes underground again.
Agents Of SHIELD	Over-the-Top Secret	
Agents Of SHIELD	Parental Abandonment	
Agents Of SHIELD	Parental Substitute	Coulson is this to Skye; emotional support, guidance, discipline...no wonder she refers to an argument between him and May as "Mom and Dad fighting".
Agents Of SHIELD	The Password Is Always "Swordfish"	The verbal pass phrase to disengage Skye's Walking Techbane bracelet is "disengage bracelet."Skye: Seriously?Coulson: I thought you'd like that.
Agents Of SHIELD	Password Slot Machine	The HYDRA activation signal in "Turn, Turn, Turn".
Agents Of SHIELD	Pet the Dog	Literally, during Ward's "origin story" flashback in "Ragtag". Ward can't bring himself to kill the dog who has been his hunting companion for five years, at Garrett's behest. However, he (or Garrett) then shoot the dog from farther away.
Agents Of SHIELD	Placebo Eureka Moment	Coulson walks in on May doing Tai-Chi in "The Hub" to discuss whether he should keep trusting the system, or question it like Skye does. He eventually decides to agree with her and keep trusting the system, even though May doesn't say a single word during the scene.
Agents Of SHIELD	Planet Baron	The planet Kitson is ruled by the Kitson family. The first Mister Kitson discovered the planet and named it after himself, while his son and later his grandson succeeded him as the rulers of the planet.
Agents Of SHIELD	Platonic Life-Partners	A good number of characters have this dynamic to different effects.
Agents Of SHIELD	Plot Archaeology	Gravitonium, a gravity-manipulating plot device first set up in the first season, doesn't appear again until Season 5, after which it becomes pivotal to the main conflict of that season.
Agents Of SHIELD	Poisoned Drink Drop	When Octavian Bloom arranges the assassination of the other HYDRA leaders in "Aftershocks", he has one of his henchmen put a poison based on the Obelisk in the Baroness's drink at the restaurant. After drinking it, she starts coughing and drops her glass, which can be heard breaking on the floor, and then her face turns to stone.
Agents Of SHIELD	Poor Communication Kills	Both Phil Coulson and Victoria Hand thought that the other was a traitor to S.H.I.E.L.D., and acted in consequence. Although there were traitors among them, neither of them was one.
Agents Of SHIELD	Portmanteau Couple Name	Used as a gag in the pilot; we only learn the name "Fitz-Simmons" actually refers to two people after it's been used a few times. Used consistently since, since they're The Dividual. invoked
Agents Of SHIELD	Power at a Price	There are many examples in the series of characters trying to acquire power and finding out that they got more than they bargained for.
Agents Of SHIELD	Power Perversion Potential	Skye points out that Creel's absorption abilities could be pretty kinky in the bedroom.
Agents Of SHIELD	Preserve Your Gays	Twofer Token Minority (gay latinx) Joey "Melty Joe" Gutierrez, whose death has been teased on at least two occasions but has been avoided both times.
Agents Of SHIELD	Prosthetic Limb Reveal	Used in-universe when Coulson and Hunter are captured by Rosalind and ATCU agents. Coulson is handcuffed to the seat in the subway and when he decides it's time to leave, he pops off his artificial hand to get out of the handcuff, catching his captors by surprise.
Agents Of SHIELD	Protagonist-Centered Morality	In the episode "T.A.H.I.T.I", two guards are killed and a facility housing a potential source of a Healing Potion is destroyed in the team's effort to save Skye. The loss is considered unfortunate by Team Coulson, but the fact that they broke into a secure facility they had no jurisdiction over, prepared to do whatever it took to save their teammate, is washed over. The narrative treats it as them doing what had to be done to save a teammate. Arc Villain Garrett kills one without remorse and after a gun fight Big Good Coulson finds the other mortally wounded and tells him he'll get medical assistance.
Agents Of SHIELD	Punny Name	In the third episode we meet Agent Mack, who drives a semi-trailer for S.H.I.E.L.D..
Agents Of SHIELD	Pure Energy	The 0-8-4 in the second episode fires a beam of it that can blast through 50 tons of solid steel.
Agents Of SHIELD	Purple Is Powerful	In "Ragtag", Raina combines the Centipede serum with the reverse-engineered sample of GH-325. The resulting fluid glows a vivid purple colour.
Agents Of SHIELD	Put on a Bus	
Agents Of SHIELD	Putting on the Reich	The HYDRA salute makes its return... and is promptly mocked as making the user look like a West Texas cheerleader.
Agents Of SHIELD	Psychic Powers	A running gag is that psychic powers don't exist. note most likely a joking nod to the fact that X-Men, and therefore mutants in general (which includes the majority of human psychics in the comics) have their film rights held by a different company and therefore unavailable to the Marvel Cinematic Universe In Episode 16, Coulson finally says that meeting an Asgardian obviously gifted with psychic powers opened up his mind on the topic.
Agents Of SHIELD	Race Lift	Alphonso "Al" MacKenzie, a white Texan in the comics, joins the cast in Season Two played by Henry Simmons note who is Black.
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	A Day in the Limelight	The show is pretty generous about featuring the supporting cast members.
Agents Of SHIELD	Radar Is Useless	During the last five episodes of Season One, the characters are still able to travel around in the 'Bus' and the Jump-Jet, including, in the former's case, touching down at an LA airport, despite the fact that HYDRA's schemes have been revealed, with the U.S. military and its allies hunting down any remnants of SHIELD. What's more bizarre is that this explicitly becomes a plot point in Season Two, with Team Coulson having to steal a Quinjet as they can't use the Bus or other non-cloaked aircraft without detection.
Agents Of SHIELD	Radiation-Induced Superpowers	It's suggested that Scorch gained his pyrokinetic abilities thanks to a nuclear plant that caught fire near his house.
Agents Of SHIELD	Ragtag Bunch of Misfits	Ward is an excellent operative but has No Social Skills (and Coulson comments that he's surprised he's not worse with his background), May has issues that make her dead-set against going back into field work with very likely a case of PTSD thrown in, Skye's a conspiracy theorist who doesn't trust S.H.I.E.L.D. at all, Fitz and Simmons are both brilliant, but are also quirky and have no field experience and Coulson himself is a previously fake-dead (later revealed to be dead-dead and revived with false memories) field agent. Though it's never the subject of a Title Drop, Episode 21 is entitled "Ragtag", presumably an allusion to this phrase.
Agents Of SHIELD	Real Life Writes the Plot	
Agents Of SHIELD	A Real Man Is a Killer	Deconstructed and ultimately subverted with Ward. He embodies a lot of popular ideas of how a "real man" looks and behaves: he's conventionally attractive, has exceptional fighting skills, and doesn't let emotions get in the way of his mission. He can also kill without hesitation or remorse, but this is never presented as a positive thing and earns him a What the Hell, Hero? when he shoots the decoy Clairvoyant. As the series goes on, it becomes clear that Ward has spent so much time following Garret's orders that he has no idea how to think for himself. Skye contrasts him against Fitz, whose compassion and willingness to believe in the good of others makes him more of a man than Ward could ever be.
Agents Of SHIELD	Reality Has No Subtitles	Initially, whenever there's a dialogue in a foreign language — usually when Ward is undercover — there aren't subtitles. This isn't always the case, and sometimes said aversions are Played for Laughs, such as Coulson's rusty Russian being accurately subtitled to demonstrate just how bad it is, and Hunter's estuary dialect being so thick that subtitles are required.
Agents Of SHIELD	Reality Is Unrealistic	
Agents Of SHIELD	Reasonable Authority Figure	
Agents Of SHIELD	Reassigned to Antarctica	"T.R.A.C.K.S." has Coulson threatening Ward with duty in Alaska, guarding The Abomination's holding cell.
Agents Of SHIELD	Reckless Gun Usage	
Agents Of SHIELD	Recruited from the Gutter	One of the Clairvoyant's agents grew up in an abusive family and was facing prison time when the Clairvoyant recruited him and gave him purpose. The result is that he has strong personal loyalty to the Clairvoyant, saying at one point that he owes the Clairvoyant "everything".
Agents Of SHIELD	Red Skies Crossover	
Agents Of SHIELD	Relative Button	
Agents Of SHIELD	Reluctant Warrior	The Norse Mythology expert in "The Well". He's an Asgardian who grew tired of his life as a warrior and settled into becoming a pacifist professor.
Agents Of SHIELD	Rescue Equipment Attack	During the Remoraths' attack on the Lighthouse in the episode "Option Two", Deke Shaw uses a fire extinguisher to spray a Remorath that was chasing Fitz at one point.
Agents Of SHIELD	Restraining Bolt	Miles and Skye are fitted with special bracelets that will allow S.H.I.E.L.D. to keep tabs on them, impair their ability to use electronic devices, and inflict other punishments as needed.
Agents Of SHIELD	Ret-Canon	This series decided to make Donnie Gill (known as "Blizzard" in the comics) a genuine superhuman with cryokinesis), as opposed to his comic book counterpart, whom used a suit he wears. In Infinity (2013) and Inhumanity, he was revealed to be an Inhuman. Due to production time, the change actually happened in the comics before Donnie even debuted on TV.
Agents Of SHIELD	Retool	
Agents Of SHIELD	Retcon	
Agents Of SHIELD	Retractable Weapon	Lady Sif's sword can shrink when she doesn't need it. It is later accidentally Bifurcated.
Agents Of SHIELD	Reusable Lighter Toss	In season 3 episode 4 one is left behind in a pool of gas to blow up a building.
Agents Of SHIELD	Reverse Relationship Reveal	the parents of Skye. Her father seems to be a monster, and her mother seems to be lovely. As it turns out, she is a genocidial leader, willing to kill humans just to keep the inhumans secret, and he's just doing what she tells him to protect Skye).
Agents Of SHIELD	Riddle for the Ages	Two regarding the Chronicons. First, they are an entire race of robots that are incredibly long lived and originally act as expies of the Watchers. They are entirely synthetic and seem to have always been. So, who built them? Relately, they are not merely "Chronicons" but insist they are "Sentient Chronicons". We are never told or hinted at what this really means. For example, what is a "Non-Sentient Chronicon"?
Agents Of SHIELD	Right Behind Me	Happens to Ward when talking about Mike.
Agents Of SHIELD	Rogues' Gallery Transplant	Given the show largely focuses on fleshing out the Marvel Cinematic Universe outside of the films, they make use of villains from the comics who wouldn't stand a chance making it to film.
Agents Of SHIELD	Room Full of Crazy	Coulson, Garret and all the people that received the alien serum have an insane compulsion to carve weird symbols anywhere, such as in walls.
Agents Of SHIELD	Running Gag	
Agents Of SHIELD	Savvy Guy, Energetic Girl	A downplayed example, with Fitz and Simmons. Simmons has a cheerfully optimistic fascination with everything new and exciting and is the one who wanted to go into the field, while Fitz is more cautious, pragmatic, and worried about potential problems.
Agents Of SHIELD	Scary Science Words	Season 2 episode "Melinda" features flashbacks to May's transformation into "the Cavalry". While May goes into a building to deal with a situation, Coulson keeps people away with this trope. He's seen debating whether to claim there's been a nuclear or biological weapons release, deciding on biological because "biological always works."Commander: Did you say biological?Coulson: [smiles] Yes I did.
Agents Of SHIELD	Science Fantasy	
Agents Of SHIELD	Screw the Rules, I'm Doing What's Right!	
Agents Of SHIELD	Screw This, I'm Outta Here!	
Agents Of SHIELD	Stock Footage	Its viral website The Rising Tide shows clips from previous movies made to look like poorly filmed camcorder footage. Funnily enough, one clip that claims to be of the Hulk is the Abomination recolored.
Agents Of SHIELD	Storming the Castle	
Agents Of SHIELD	Secret Test	In a flashback, Peggy Carter leaves Werner Reinhardt in an interrogation chamber and intentionally leaves a pen on the table. He comments that she obviously wanted to see what he would do with it, since a pen can have so many uses, "Escape, confession, homicide... suicide." She agrees:Agent Carter: It's true. I wanted to find out what kind of man you were. You didn't use the pen, so now I know.
Agents Of SHIELD	Seen It All	
Agents Of SHIELD	Series Fauxnale	Season Five finale "The End" was clearly written as a series finale and ended with Coulson being allowed to die in peace. After the series was unexpectedly picked up for two more seasons, the creators had to get creative in order to keep Clark Gregg on as the face of the show.
Agents Of SHIELD	Sequel Hook	
Agents Of SHIELD	Shapeshifting Heals Wounds	Whenever Robbie Reyes turns into Ghost Rider, any injuries he sustained as a human disappear after he returns to normal. With the exception of one Wound That Will Not Heal crack across his skull.
Agents Of SHIELD	Shattered World	In season five's opening two-parter, after being hurled forward through time by a white monolith, a look out a porthole at the end of the first half reveals that the space station they agents are stranded aboard is orbiting the floating debris of what was once Earth. While most of the Kree-enslaved human population are too busy just trying to stay alive to provide any kind of history, local fixer Deke points the finger at Daisy, or, as he prefers to call her, Quake, Destroyer of Worlds.
Agents Of SHIELD	She Cleans Up Nicely	
Agents Of SHIELD	Shell-Shocked Veteran	Melinda May aka The Cavalry was so shaken up by the event where she earned that nickname that she asked for a desk job and was extremely reluctant to go back into the field.
Agents Of SHIELD	Shipper on Deck	
Agents Of SHIELD	Ship Tease	
Agents Of SHIELD	Shout-Out	Has its own page.
Agents Of SHIELD	Shown Their Work	
Agents Of SHIELD	Shut Up, Hannibal!	
Agents Of SHIELD	Sigil Spam	
Agents Of SHIELD	Simulated Fantasy, Post-Apocalyptic Reality	In the fifth season, the Team find themselves transported to a Bad Future where the Earth has been almost completely destroyed and the remnants of humanity were relocated to a space station controlled by the Kree. There they find one of their residents, Deke, is running a Framework simulation that lets people experience an approximation of Earth before it was destroyed. Daisy lampshades it as an opium den, and Deke admits that the Kree let him get away with it because it keeps the people docile.
Agents Of SHIELD	Sinister Car	Ghost Rider's Hell Charger. The Rider's power lets the car heal itself and shoot flames. Eventually subverted, as it turns out Robbie isn't really a villain at all.
Agents Of SHIELD	Sixth Ranger	
Agents Of SHIELD	Sleep Deprivation Punishment	Akela Amador is revealed to be being Forced into Evil by lack of sleep when the team sees a feed from her eye where she writes a note to her handler saying "Can I sleep?", to which her handler replies via text feed with an order to continue her mission. It establishing the Centipede group's MO of using their Explosive Leash cybernetic eyes to force people to do their bidding.
Agents Of SHIELD	Something Only They Would Say	Ace proved Mike that he was free by writing those words he sees in his eye. But those are just words, how can Mike be sure it's really him? Because he said "What are we? We are a team"
Agents Of SHIELD	Sparing Them the Dirty Work	In the season 2 finale, Cal ends up killing Jiaying so Skye won't have to live with the pain of killing her own mother, telling her "let me live with it instead" (Cal still loves Jiaying, but has come to realize she's become a monster bent on wiping out humanity). Mercifully, Skye arranges for Cal to have his memory erased so he doesn't have to live with the pain either.
Agents Of SHIELD	Spin-Off	From The Avengers and the rest of the MCU. Specifically, Coulson from the films becomes The Leader on a new cast with separate adventures.
Agents Of SHIELD	Special Edition Title	
Agents Of SHIELD	Spiritual Successor	
Agents Of SHIELD	Spoiler Opening	the opening cast credits for "The Beginning of the End" spoil the "surprise" appearance of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury midway through the episode. To be fair, however, ABC's own promos for the episode had already spoiled his appearance and US entertainment media spoiled that Jackson would be appearing in the finale a full month before.
Agents Of SHIELD	Spontaneous Human Combustion	The unstable Extremis in the Centipede serum tends to cause them to explode apparently at random.
Agents Of SHIELD	Standard Snippet	The Hydra leitmotif borrows from the "Dies Irae" chant.
Agents Of SHIELD	Star-Crossed Lovers	The FitzSimmons pairing was a mess that stretched four seasons. They spend the entire first season at Cannot Spit It Out. When they finally move past that, Fitz gets injured and spends half the next season recovering, while Simmons leaves the team to take an undercover assignment. When those are finally resolved, Simmons develops a case of Fantastic Racism that upsets Fitz, and the Real SHIELD civil war breaks out, causing further complications lasting the rest of the season. When things finally calm down enough for Fitz to ask Simmons out, she gets eaten by an alien rock. They finally get her back in "Purpose In The Machine", but she definitely looks too traumatized for a relationship. Then it turns out that she's already in one with another guy who was trapped on an alien planet with her. Then it turns out he died shortly after she escaped. The two finally manage to start an actual relationship near the end of season three, but in keeping with their never-ending string of bad luck, their respective jobs in season four are already set up to cause tension between them, after which Fitz is kidnapped, has his brain uploaded into a virtual reality, and gets influenced into becoming a sadistic HYDRA operative who is the lover of an evil AI. Fitz even described them as "cursed" right before their Big Damn Kiss. In the fifth season premier, when Team Coulson is sent to space actually a Bad Future, Fitz is the only one that isn't sent with the team. It's at this point that Daisy, the couple's Best Friend after each other and who once declared that she would go through an army of LMDs to reunite them, agrees that Fitz may be onto something with the whole curse thing.  As Coulson is officiating FitzSimmons their wedding in season 5, he says that any delays would be "playing with fire", and sounds like he's only partially joking. At the end of the season,  Fitz dies but there's a back-up version of him in suspended animation that the team sets out to find. The Season 6 finale sees Fitz and Simmons separated again, apparently with each unable to know where the other is for unspecified reasons as part of a plan to defeat the Chronicoms.
Agents Of SHIELD	Start of Darkness	
Agents Of SHIELD	Status Quo Is God	
Agents Of SHIELD	Stealth Hi/Bye	The antagonist in "Repairs" can appear and disappear at will, and pulls several entrances and exits that are functionally this trope. Then, during his first attack on May, she disappears on him.
Agents Of SHIELD	Stealth Pun	The "noisemakers" in "The Beginning of the End" are disguised as graggers, a type of noisemaker commonly used during the Jewish festival of Purim. They're even activated by spinning them, which is exactly how you make noise with the real thing.
Agents Of SHIELD	Weapon Specialization	
Agents Of SHIELD	Straight Gay	Subverted with Victoria Hand and and Isabelle Hartley, the showrunners have deliberately avoided assigning a sexuality to them when considering the implications of two well-adjusted, non-stereotypical gay characters (like they were in the comics) and then killing them both immediately.
Agents Of SHIELD	Sufficiently Advanced Aliens	"The Well" contains a discussion about the Asgardians, who are stated to be advanced aliens that early humans simply mistook for gods. Skye then jokingly asks if Vishnu is an alien as well, which caused criticism from real life Hindus.
Agents Of SHIELD	Sufficiently Analyzed Magic	The Darkhold's contents in Season 4 seem to be either this or Scientifically Understandable Sorcery. It feeds into the MCU's general theme of science and magic being two sides of the same coin.
Agents Of SHIELD	Superdickery	The series is rather fond of this. For example:
Agents Of SHIELD	Supernatural Scandiavia	n "The Well", it's revealed that a warrior from the Asgardian Berserker Army decided to stay behind on Earth rather than return, becoming "The Warrior Who Stayed" and hiding one piece of the super-empowering Berserker staff within the forest of what would become Trillemarka National Parknote It is called this in the episode, but is known in real life as the Trillemarka Nature Reserve in Norway. In the present day of the episode, a Norse Paganist hate group travel to Trillemarka to retrieve the piece, believing they could use it to become gods on Earth. Coulson's S.H.I.E.L.D. team travels to stop them by finding the remaining pieces before they do.
Agents Of SHIELD	Super Prototype	Averted with the Nite-Nite gun. It's a decent nonlethal weapon, but Fitz's ICER is a superior weapon. The team still uses both because the Nite-Nite gun still works, but the ICER is seeing higher production numbers.
Agents Of SHIELD	Super Serum	
Agents Of SHIELD	Take That, Audience!	An extremely blatant example in the Season 2 finale to the fans who believed Ward's tragic past excused his villainous actions. Since The Reveal these fans gathered under the hashtag #standwithward. In the episode Kara states that based on said tragic past "I love him and I will always stand with Ward". This is treated as a clear sign that 33 has gone off the moral deep end and is preceded by a Kirk Summation on exactly why using one's tragic past as an excuse for one's clearly wrong actions does not make one a good guy. This comes to its logical conclusion when Ward fatally shoots her down at the end of the season, mistaking her for May, whom she was disguised as at the time. Even Ward sympathizers aren't safe from his actions.
Agents Of SHIELD	Take the Third Option	
Agents Of SHIELD	Talk to the Fist	In "The Magical Place", a very angry Skye walks into the house where Coulson is being held by Raina, who hastily tries to claim that what she's doing is for Coulson's own good. Skye downs her with one punch.
Agents Of SHIELD	Technobabble	A good deal of Fitz-Simmons' "science" talk and to a slightly lesser degree Skye's hacking talk falls into this category. Basically, the writers know just enough to throw in some technical-sounding terms with their made-up explanations for how things work.
Agents Of SHIELD	The Tag	Episodes usually end with one. It's not unlike the movies' use of The Stinger.
Agents Of SHIELD	The Team	Coulson handpicked a number of people to create a response team for stuff like Mike and the HYDRA tesseract cannon. He himself is The Leader and he chose them for their skills: Ward for his combat and stealth, Fitz-Simmons for their science, Skye for her hacking, May to "drive the bus". As of the third episode, May has decided that sitting back isn't for her, and requested to be put into combat. Although Coulson questions her decision, it's hard not to see it as a Just as Planned moment. Fury really recruited May to keep an eye on Coulson and she picked the team members. Fury then manipulated Coulson into recruiting them by giving him a mission profile that would require their specific profiles.
Agents Of SHIELD	Team Dad	Coulson is the oldest and the leader thus the affectionate yet tough dad. May is effectively his female counterpart though a lot more strict than is usual for this trope. Skye even referred to them as "Mom and Dad" in "Eye Spy".
Agents Of SHIELD	Techno Wizard	Fitz-Simmons fill this role for science-y things, while Skye is this with computers.
Agents Of SHIELD	Tele-Frag	
Agents Of SHIELD	Teleportation Rescue	In the second season, Gordon the teleporter rescues several people this way. He does it for Raina at the end of "Aftershocks" when she's surrounded by SHIELD troops, and for Skye at the end of "One Door Closes".
Agents Of SHIELD	Teleport Spam	Tobias can do this via jumping back and forth between dimensions like Nightcrawler and so can Gordon.
Agents Of SHIELD	Temple of Doom	The only passage between the Fear dimension and ours is in the Temple of the Forgotten, an ancient temple built by the Mayans with the same material as the three Monoliths. There is also an identical replica of the Temple in the Fear Dimension.
Agents Of SHIELD	Tempting Fate	
Agents Of SHIELD	The Watson	Skye/Daisy Johnson serves this role, especially in the first few episodes. She would frequently ask questions or go against S.H.I.E.L.D.'s policies, with both often resulting in trial by fire and/or a history lesson. She still serves a minor role as The Watson in the third season, but usually simply asking questions about some shared knowledge that she isn't in on, resulting in a less painful history lesson.
Agents Of SHIELD	The Fellowship Has Ended	In the series finale.  All the remaining members of main team are now heading up their own responsibilities within Shield or have retired from the game altogether. The group still keeps in touch and even send gifts to Fitz and Simmons' child, but it's unlikely that they'll ever all be together in person at once ever again.
Agents Of SHIELD	There Are No Therapists	Zig-zagged.
Agents Of SHIELD	They Look Just Like Everyone Else!	The big reveal of Captain America: The Winter Soldier fell like an atom bomb in S.H.I.E.L.D., both the team and the whole organization. Who is a traitor? May? Fitz? Ward? Skye? Hand? Coulson? Triplett? Garret? Those unnamed agents coming to us? How many of them?
Agents Of SHIELD	This Is for Emphasis, Bitch!	Both Fitz and Simmons have their moments:
Agents Of SHIELD	Time Skip	Season 5's final episode is set hours from the ending of Avengers: Infinity War. Season 6 begins a year after the events of Avengers: Endgame.
Agents Of SHIELD	Time-Travel Romance	Season 7 sparks the beginning of one of these between, of all people,  Daisy and a plucked-from-his-time Daniel Sousa
Agents Of SHIELD	Tome of Eldritch Lore	The Darkhold, which is introduced in Season Four, is a book containing limitless information about everything in whatever mother-tongue its user has. It also corrupts their moral compass so they're willing to do all kinds of nasty deeds to possess it and gain power from it. It only took Radcliffe a glimpse at less than 2 of its pages for it to corrupt him.
Agents Of SHIELD	Tonight, Someone Dies	
Agents Of SHIELD	Too Dumb to Live	As of "Turn, Turn, Turn", Victoria Hand. Every major call she makes through her run in the series is wrong, up to allowing one of Garrett's own proteges to escort him to the Freezer when she knows that S.H.I.E.L.D. has been deeply infiltrated by HYDRA. One wonders how she got to be such a high-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. agent in the first place.
Agents Of SHIELD	Took a Level in Badass	
Agents Of SHIELD	Took a Level in Jerkass	
Agents Of SHIELD	Trailers Always Spoil	
Agents Of SHIELD	Training from Hell	Ward's introduction to S.H.I.E.L.D. started with Garrett stranding him in the wilderness for six months with nothing but a bag of clothes and a hunting dog.
Agents Of SHIELD	Train Job	In "T.R.A.C.K.S.", the team goes undercover to investigate an organization with links to Centipede on a train.
Agents Of SHIELD	Tranquillizer Dart	The Night-Night rifle and its pistol equivalent the Night-Light gun, the latter able to fire multiple shots. It is later given the cooler name ICER. In Season 2, while ICERs are still used, the team also increasingly uses fully lethal sniper rifles.
Agents Of SHIELD	Treachery Is a Special Kind of Evil	Even when there are wheels within wheels rolling and he holds many secrets (and understands other people have them), if there is something that will drive Phil Coulson up the wall immediately, it is even thinking of stabbing the team in the back.
Agents Of SHIELD	Truth Serums	Used in the pilot when Skye is captured. However, it's not used on Skye, but rather on Ward, so that she can trust Coulson. A couple episodes later, Ward claims that S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't have a truth serum and he was just playing along. Given the events of later episodes, he's probably right.
Agents Of SHIELD	Tomato Surprise	In "Shadows", the "Simmons" that Fitz has been talking to turns out to be a hallucination.
Agents Of SHIELD	Two-Faced Aside	When Talbot gave some orders to Coulson, he politely replied that it "Sounds good!" with a smile, then close the communication and said with a serious face "This doesn't sound good!"
Agents Of SHIELD	Uncanny Family Resemblance	The Koenig brothers, Four of them, are all played by Patton Oswalt.
Agents Of SHIELD	Underside Ride	In "The Hub", Ward and Fitz use a magnetic pouch to attach themselves to the bottom of a truck in order to gain access to the separatist compound.
Agents Of SHIELD	Understatement	In the pilot Coulson states that he's certain that he was dead for longer than eight seconds. "The Magical Place" reveals that he was right — by several orders of magnitude.
Agents Of SHIELD	Ungrateful Bastard	After the events of Winter Soldier, S.H.I.E.L.D has been labelled a terrorist organization and the surviving agents are being hunted down by national militaries. It's a case of Surprisingly Realistic Outcome, but after all the good they've done a little slack would be nice. What happened to the World Security Council isn't mentioned*Though The Winter Soldier makes it clear that all but one (that one being the woman Black Widow impersonated are killed by Alexander Pierce.
Agents Of SHIELD	Unholy Matrimony	Many examples of villainous couples throughout the show, actually.
Agents Of SHIELD	The Unmasqued World	
Agents Of SHIELD	Unobtainium	"Gravitonium" is a supposedly naturally-occurring element (symbol Gr) mined out of the earth with an atomic number of 123. Its physical properties, not the least of which is gravity manipulation, fall squarely in the realm of Artistic License – Physics. The explanation for how it manipulates gravity is pure, unadulterated technobabble.
Agents Of SHIELD	Unspoken Plan Guarantee	
Agents Of SHIELD	Unusually Uninteresting Sight	In "Nothing Personal", Coulson lands his flying car in the middle of a Los Angeles street and the only reaction to this is for a parking attendant to come over and tell him that the parking spot costs twenty bucks. Justified because this is the Marvel Cinematic Universe post-Battle of New York: Billionaires fly around in big suits of armor, aliens have visited from another planet, and there's a guy out there who turns into a giant green rage-monster, all of which the general public now knows about. Comparatively, a flying car doesn't really rate that much shock.
Agents Of SHIELD	Vagueness Is Coming	Happens a lot in the first two-thirds of the first season, before it's revealed that Project Centipede is a branch of HYDRA.
Agents Of SHIELD	Vehicle Vanish	Akela does this at the start of "Eye-Spy", vanishing as a train passes through a subway station. She seems to be doing this for the benefit of the camera as there's no one else there to witness it.
Agents Of SHIELD	Villain of Another Story	
Agents Of SHIELD	Villainous Breakdown	
Agents Of SHIELD	Villainous Friendship	The Clairvoyant and The Dragon, Garrett and Ward, seem to be honest friends who regularly meet up for lunch, and make bets on who pays for such while attacking prisons to steal hidden weapons of mass destruction. Moreso from the dragon's end, as while the Clairvoyant basically took him under his wing since he was a teen and the dragon clearly panicks when he nearly dies (and while treating his acting up cybernetics, seems to act in the same manner someone would when helping a diabetic friend who needs help with their insulin injection, casually doing so like they've done it many times before), but the Clairvoyant has also clearly been emotionally abusing him since he's met him (as he does to everyone), and would gladly sacrifice him if it would help his plans along.
Agents Of SHIELD	Villain Has a Point	Dr. Hall wants to destroy the Graviton device in spite of collateral damage because he doesn't believe that any group is responsible enough to control it. He cites the events of The Avengers as evidence that S.H.I.E.L.D. can't do it either. Coulson doesn't argue the point; "You're not wrong".
Agents Of SHIELD	Villains Want Mercy	Two examples in "Beginning of the End": first, when The Mole finds themselves nailed to the floor by May, they try to plead with her, only to get punched in the throat, crushing their larynx. Then, when Deathlok breaks free of Garrett's control and turns on him, he pleads with Coulson to make Deathlok stop, only for Coulson to stand by and watch.
Agents Of SHIELD	Villain with Good Publicity	
Agents Of SHIELD	The Virus	The weird Chitauri contamination in FZZT is weird because it infects someone through electrical discharge.
Agents Of SHIELD	Visionary Villain	
Agents Of SHIELD	Weak, but Skilled	In "Inside Voices", Ruby proves herself to be vastly superior to Carl Creel in terms of fighting skill, easily dodging almost every one of his blows while getting off some strong hits of her own...and it does almost nothing to him, because no matter how skilled and acrobatic a fighter she is, a 90-pound girl fighting with punches and kicks is going to have a negligible effect on a fully grown man who's twice her size and built like a freight train, and that's without taking his Elemental Shapeshifter abilities into account.
Agents Of SHIELD	We Have Become Complacent	A major problem for S.H.I.E.L.D. as an organization. They seem to take for granted that their status as the world's protectors from the dangerous and supernatural has granted them an enormous amount of leeway on the subject of human rights, for one thing. It comes back to bite them hard when HYDRA's infiltration comes to light; the organization gets labelled a terrorist organization and every intelligence agency and military force in the world turns against them.

Agents Of SHIELD	Wham Shot	
Agents Of SHIELD	What Did You Expect When You Named It ____?	In "The Only Light in the Darkness," Coulson says the man they're after got his powers while working on project "Dark Force," then dryly remarks, "Because nothing bad ever happens when you're working on a project named 'Dark Force'."
Agents Of SHIELD	Whatever Happened to the Mouse?	The plot with Franklin Hall, the Gravitonium, and Ian Quinn wasn't touched at all after the first season, leading many to assume this. They were finally brought back for the end of season 5.
Agents Of SHIELD	What the Heck Is an Aglet?	At the end of the episode "Repairs", most of Coulson's team is shown playing Scrabble. Simmons makes the word "aglet", which leads to an argument about whether it's a real word, settled when Skye looks it up online.
Agents Of SHIELD	What the Hell, Hero?	There are a number of instances in the show, most notably in
Agents Of SHIELD	When Things Spin, Science Happens	In the episode "The Asset", there's Dr. Franklin Hall's giant graviton machine.
Agents Of SHIELD	Who You Gonna Call?	The government agency type. S.H.I.E.L.D. is responsible for keeping weird and dangerous stuff contained so it doesn't hurt anyone.
Agents Of SHIELD	Whole Costume Reference	
Agents Of SHIELD	Why Don't You Just Shoot Him?	Averted in "T.R.A.C.K.S." by Ian Quinn. After a "robot speech" with Mike, asking if he would shoot Skye if he orders him so, Mike left... and Quinn simply shot Skye himself
Agents Of SHIELD	Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds	Joey from Season 3. Melting everything around himself, constantly apologizing, and really afraid.
Agents Of SHIELD	Would Hit a Girl	
Agents Of SHIELD	Writing Around Trademarks	As mentioned above, the writers developed the terms "gifted", "miracle", and "enhanced" to compensate for not being allowed to use the term "mutant" thanks to the X-Men Film Series. Later on the Inhumans were used as a substitute: anyone may have dormant Inhuman genes and get them unlocked without warning, revealing unexpected superhuman powers; and also for the Fantastic Racism thing.
Agents Of SHIELD	Wrong Genre Savvy	
Agents Of SHIELD	X-Ray Vision	This enables the thief to find diamonds and kill people in darkness with her eyes shut in "Eye Spy". Also played for laughs during the episode's stinger, when Fitz wants Skye to use it to see cards but she reminds him that she'll also see him naked. After Fitz gives up and walks away, Skye uses it to check out Ward.
Agents Of SHIELD	Yandere	Aida turns into this when Fits tells her he can only love Simmons. There is much screaming, killing, and a declaration of making him love her.
Agents Of SHIELD	Year Inside, Hour Outside	A combination of this and The Slow Path caused by Time Travel in Season 7 means that different members of the team experience drastically different amounts of time over their last mission. For Piper and Flint it has been minutes, for Daisy, Yo-Yo and May it has been days or weeks, for Mack, Deke and Coulson it has been over 20 months, for Fitz and Simmons it has been over 5 years and for Enoch it has been over four decades.
Agents Of SHIELD	You Are Too Late	
Agents Of SHIELD	You Have Failed Me	
Agents Of SHIELD	You Wouldn't Shoot Me	
Ala Dina	As Himself	Aristocrat Alessandro Lecquio, news anchors José Ribagorda and Lorenzo Milá, swimmer David Meca and singers Juan Camus, Carlos Baute and Natalia all made cameos playing themselves at different points of the show.
Ala Dina	Fish out of Temporal Water	No actual time travels involved, but spending four centuries locked in a magic lamp without any contact to the outside had pretty much the same effect on Dina.
Ala Dina	Inept Mage	Dina, big time. In fact, it's what got her locked away in the lamp: wanting to help King Philip II's Armada, she cast a spell to grant the ships a good weather that instead intensified the wind and caused the mission to fail, so the king, furious, sentenced her to confinement. And judging by the chaos that ensues any time she casts one of her spells, her magic skills haven't improved one iota since that incident.
Ala Dina	Love Triangle	During the first season there was one involving Dina, Tomás and Paloma (a co-worker of his). He chooses Dina.
Ala Dina	The Nth Doctor	When Paz Padilla exited the series and was replaced by Miriam Díaz-Aroca in the lead role, Dina's change of appearance was explained as her body transforming through The Power of Love.
Ala Dina	Pun-Based Title	An obvious reference to Aladdin.
Ala Dina	Really 700 Years Old	Dina's exact age is unknown, but it's known that she has spent about 411 years locked in her magic lamp.
Ala Dina	Romancing the Widow	Dina and Tomás fall in love with each other.
Ala Dina	Scullery Maid	Dina's job at the García León household.
Airwolf	The Ace	At first, it's claimed that Stringfellow is among the handful of people in the world, if not the only one, who can successfully fly Airwolf into combat, due to the fact The Lady is such an experimentally high-performance aircraft, capable of going into rotor-free "Turbo mode". After joining the cast, flying prodigy Caitlin acquires the necessary skill set through observing him. Dom flies Airwolf as well, even going into turbo mode on a few occasions in the second and third seasons, but he never engages in combat while doing this.
Airwolf	Ace Pilot	Stringfellow and almost certainly Dominic qualify.
Airwolf	Actor Allusion	the pilot episode "Shadow of the Hawke" takes its name from the 1976 film "Shadow of the Hawk", both starring Jan-Michael Vincent.
Airwolf	Adjective Noun Fred	Market-Based Title: The Japanese dub is known as "Chou Onsoku Kougeki Helinote "Supersonic Attack Helicopter" Airwolf".
Airwolf	Affirmative Action Girl	Caitlin joins the guys in the second season.
Airwolf	Ambiguous Situation	At the conclusion of the fourth season opener "Blackjack" it is left unclear what happens to Stringfellow after St. John takes him from the hospital. St. John returns to the lair in Airwolf alone telling his friends there was "something he had to do", and the matter is quietly dropped. Caitlin's fate is also left unknown whilst Archangel has been redeployed to the Middle East.
Airwolf	And Starring	"With" Alex Cord "And" Ernest Borgnine as Dominic Santini.
Airwolf	Artificial Intelligence	Though not played with much in the series, Airwolf does have a primitive AI system that monitors and constantly optimizes the copter's systems. It also learns from and can assist the pilot in combat situations. These abilities are utilized in "Moffett's Ghost", as Airwolf has to find its own way to Langley and to deal with the situations it's in. These precise situations are not likely to be things Moffett could have predicted or programmed the autopilot to do without such AI, as he had no idea where Airwolf would be or what it would be doing if he were dead or in jail at that point in time.
Airwolf	A-Team Firing	Spectacularly averted. When Stringfellow Hawke shoots, he shoots to kill. Also, as stated in Mind Of The Machine, it's nearly impossible to miss a ground target with Airwolf's targeting systems.
Airwolf	Atrocious Alias	Somewhat. "Stringfellow" isn't really the name most people would associate with a badass action hero. But Hawke most certainly is.
Airwolf	Attack Its Weak Point	The normally bullet-proof Airwolf can be destroyed by even a pistol round if it gets into the mid-air refuelling intake. Admittedly, Truth in Television for inlets like that, in that real life planes have been brought down by something getting into the similarly vunerable pitot tubes and blocking them.
Airwolf	Bittersweet Ending	The ending of the pilot episode. Airwolf is recovered, but Gabrielle is dead. Archangel: "Did...she suffer?"(long pause)Hawke: "What difference does it make?"Archangel: "Dammit, I sent her out there, I wanna know!"(long pause)Hawke: No... no, she didn't suffer.Archangel: "....thank God for that."
Airwolf	Black Helicopter	It's black for a start,note Well, technically it's a dark charcoal gray, with a white underside designed to be a "wolf in sheep's clothing" as the flight suit badge references.
Airwolf	Bland-Name Product	One episode shows a package of what is very clearly Red Man chewing tobacco, but with the name on the label changed to "Big Chief."
Airwolf	Brought Down to Badass	Under normal circumstances, Airwolf is basically unstoppable and can take out just about any other aircraft there is. In one episode, the team is forced to strip all of the weapons in order to allow for more fuel and passengers (they had to fly all the way into Russia to rescue an outed spy) and even without any weapons at all they still managed to down an armed helicopter, flip two jeeps just by hitting the boosters near them, and outrun four MIG fighters.
Airwolf	Casino Episode	One episode has a mob-run casino seek to expand by muscling out local shops and marginalizing the townsfolk. When corrupt police won't help, More Dakka solves the problem.
Airwolf	Cloak and Dagger	The Firm is a fictional spy agency.
Airwolf	Computer Virus	Dr. Moffett left a virus in Airwolf's computer system that activates in "Moffett's Ghost", in case he didn't succeed in stealing Airwolf. As the trope hadn't become common knowledge at the time, exposition on what a computer virus was had to be included.
Airwolf	Code Name	"Archangel," real name Michael Coldsmith-Briggs III
Airwolf	Coffin Contraband	In "Half-Pint," an American running a mercy operation to repatriate the bodies of American soldiers from Vietnam is actually using the coffins to smuggle cocaine.
Airwolf	Companion Cube	Dom Santini treats the titular helicopter this way, referring to it as "Lady" and actually having conversations with it from time to time. Although Airwolf does have a rudimentary A.I. it is not (as far as we know) actually intelligent.
Airwolf	Cool Plane	The titular helicopter is heavily armed above and beyond having nearly infinite ammo capacity, can take abuse that few other helicopters can survive, and with the help of Nitro Boost can even go supersonic.
Airwolf	Dirty Communists	Although some episodes go out of their way to have sympathetic Russian characters, most notably in "Proof Through the Night" when a deep-cover American agent was forced to come home... and the very Russian family he now had thanks to the length of his cover was forced with him.
Airwolf	Disney Death	String is the master of this. Often when it appears he can't outrun a missile, he'll dodge behind a sand dune or blow it up at the last minute, appearing to have been taken out with it. Airwolf then proceeds to fly over a sand dune or around a hill, in front of the badguy, Jason Voorhees-style. In one episode he does this with a B-52 bombing run simulating a nuclear attack.Stringfellow Hawke: I was born in that briar patch!
Airwolf	Dodge by Braking	A common combat tactic was to slam open Airwolf's air brakes causing a pursuing aircraft to overshoot. Justified because Airwolf is a helicopter and can come to a dead stop in midair, while conventional aircraft cannot.
Airwolf	Doom Magnet	
Airwolf	Downer Ending	A post-series variation of the trope. While many of the aircraft featured on the show are still flying in various roles to this day, the Bell 222A’s used as Airwolf, as well as its on-screen rival, Redwolf (or Airwolf II), suffered sad fates:
Airwolf	Drama-Preserving Handicap	Airwolf is a complex machine and like any machine, it can break down or malfunction from time to time. When this happens in combat, it can even the odds of what should be a Curb-Stomp Battle. For example, in one episode Airwolf had a malfunction that caused one of its engines to stall out when banking left. In the middle of a fight, this put it at a severe disadvantage.
Airwolf	Elaborate Underground Base	Although there's not much in there, it's inside an extinct volcano and Airwolf takes off through the top.
Airwolf	Enemy Scan	Arguably one of the chopper's coolest features.
Airwolf	Equipment Upgrade	Lasers in the Airwolf world are powerful, so the Airwolf itself gets a laser weapon in Season 4.
Airwolf	Evil Twin	
Airwolf	Exact Words	Stringfellow agreed to return Airwolf to the Firm, and presumably the Company in the final season. They never, at any time, said it would go any further than that, allowing the Company to reassign it to his brother and leave most of the arrangement between String and Dom in place effectively permanently, with the only difference being their handler knows where Airwolf is at all times.
Airwolf	Eyepatch of Power	Dark Individual Lens Of Power, as worn by Archangel after losing an eye when Moffett first stole Airwolf. He also has a medical eyepatch in parts 1 and 2 and the early parts of part 3.
Airwolf	Faked Rip Van Winkle	On Stringfellow, which involves a fake news story about Charles and Diana separating.
Airwolf	Failure Is the Only Option	Once Stringfellow finds his brother, he has to return Airwolf to the FIRM...until the 4th season, anyway.
Airwolf	Fair Cop	Caitlin used to work for the Texas Highway Patrol.
Airwolf	Gatling Good	Averted; Airwolf is equipped with chain guns. Unfortunately "chain gun" is a registered trademark so no reference is made to them past the first episode, preventing them from becoming a trope of their own.
Airwolf	Grand Theft Prototype	The Pilot Movie involved Airwolf being stolen by Moffett during the prototype stage and flown to Libya. Stringfellow is recruited to steal it back.
Airwolf	Gunship Rescue	Airwolf has a tendency to pull these off.
Airwolf	Guy in Back	Dom or Caitlin, but on two occasions, Archangel.
Airwolf	Hunting the Most Dangerous Game	The episode "Sweet Britches" involves the African Hunt Club Ranch, a safari club where customers can pay to hunt wild game from Africa - and occasionally prisoners from the local county jail.
Airwolf	Helmet-Mounted Sight	There are helmet visors that the pilots wear in combat situations. It's a Downplayed Trope, however, because lowering the visor and gaining information from it is only ever done rarely due to the Helmets Are Hardly Heroic effect.
Airwolf	Hypocrite	In the episode "Santini's Millions," Dom ends up on the board of directors of a major corporation (it makes sense in context) and ends up derailing his first board meeting when he realizes the company is charging the U.S. Air Force $16,000 a piece for aircraft sensors that he himself recently bought for Santini Air for $160, and he yells at them for ripping off the American taxpayers. Three episodes later, in "Severance Pay" Dom reveals that he's charging the Firm $4,000 for repairs to Airwolf despite having fixed it himself with parts from a coffee percolator. (The Firm does receive government funding, also, so this is also ripping off the taxpayers.) Sure, the amount is far less, but Dom is still doing the same thing he previously complained about other people doing.
Airwolf	In Space, Everyone Can See Your Face	Airwolf doesn't go into space, but the crew's helmets have dark visors that can be sealed in case of pressure loss, but are normally open to allow the actor's eyes to be seen, though the helmets do cover the actors' lower faces like a conventional aircraft flight helmet.
Airwolf	Instrumental Theme Tune	The legendary techno track that opens the show is one of the best and most memorable parts. The original from the pilot episode was hybrid synth orchestra.
Airwolf	Just Plane Wrong	See that page for all the examples of "this would never work with a real aircraft", as well as "That's not an F-16! That's an F-4!" or "That's not a Mirage! That's a Hawker Hunter!".
Airwolf	Literary Allusion Title	"Proof Through The Night", a rather clever pun as it involves Airwolf having to carry proof about Soviet chemical weapon testing through the night out of the USSR.
Airwolf	Mecha Show	After a fashion. While no actual mecha appear, the way the titular helicopter is treated as the main "character", and is able to do things no real helicopter could, is straight out of this genre.
Airwolf	Mook Mobile	Thanks in great part to Hawke's flying skills, Airwolf destroys hordes of enemy helicopters in many episodes, frequently with individual components that are superior to Airwolf's. However, as the bumper sticker that clearly belongs on Airwolf's fuselage reads: "Outnumbered? Yes. Outgunned? Maybe. Outclassed? Never."Archangel: They haven't invented a machine yet that can out-fly a good pilot.
Airwolf	More Dakka	The Airwolf's chainguns are 4 .50 machine guns and a pair of 30mm cannons to unleash a hail of bullets on the enemy.
Airwolf	Murphy's Bullet	Invoked in "Shadow of the Hawke". The Big Bad Dr. Moffett positions his helicopter to the exact spot where it'd be vulnerable to a Golden BB, counting that, because of Finagle's Law, it won't miss.
Airwolf	Myth Arc	From the first episode to the end of the third season, the myth arc is Stringfellow Hawke knows the Firm want Airwolf back, but he wants his brother back, so refuses to return it until they confirm his recovery. At the start of the fourth season, St. John is rescued, meaning that the government can reclaim Airwolf at their leisure. However, all they do is place their own crew in it, which happens to include St. John and Dom's niece, and continue the arrangement as is, since no-one said they would have to return it to the US Military, only that it be returned to the Firm/Company once St. John was returned alive.
Airwolf	Nigh-Invulnerable	One episode shows how tough the Airwolf is. Captured by Soviets, they try to enter the locked Airwolf by using a diamond drill on it. The only result is a broken drill. Pretty much the only things that are a threat to Airwolf are missiles and laser beams.
Airwolf	No-Gear Level	In "Proof Through the Night", String is forced to leave Airwolf's weapons behind in order to have enough fuel and lift to carry passengers out of Russia. He's thus forced to be creative when Soviet troops show up. See Weaponized Exhaust below.
Airwolf	No Plans, No Prototype, No Backup	Justified because Airwolf is the prototype, Dr. Moffet was the designer - and he destroyed the facility where it was designed and manufactured in the pilot episode just before stealing it and defecting to Lybia. And Hawke killed him while retrieving Airwolf. It's later revealed that Airwolf has it's design plans stored in it's onboard computer.
Airwolf	Noodle Incident	
Airwolf	Number Two	Marella seems to be this for Archangel.
Airwolf	Opening Narration	All episodes of Season One after the pilot opened with a briefing narrated by actor Lance LeGault, explaining Airwolf's purpose and how it was stolen by String.Narrator: This briefing is from file A56-7W, classified top secret. Subject is Airwolf, a mach one plus attack helicopter, with the most advanced weapons systems in the air today...
Airwolf	Post-Mortem Comeback	The mad creator of Airwolf had a program hidden inside it that nearly caused it to trigger World War III. The creator's been dead for quite a while, yet his revenge wasn't complete.
Airwolf	Recycled with a Gimmick	Knight Rider....WITH A HELICOPTER!
Airwolf	Redemption Equals Death	In "Once A Hero", Wallace reveals that he was responsible for betraying his fellow POWs by giving their escape plans to a prison-camp guard during the Vietnam War (albeit under extreme duress). When the team is ambushed by Laotian troops manning a hidden machinegun nest, he sacrifices himself by jumping into the machinegun nest with a live grenade while the enemy troops are reloading - and by taking out the enemy machinegunners, he's able to let the rest of the team escape with the prisoners they've rescued.
Airwolf	Red Scare	The main villains.
Airwolf	Retool	Season 4 was made for USA Network that brought in a major revision of the show. All of the "flying" scenes consisted of either recycled footage from previous seasons, or use of an RC copter due to having almost No Budget.
Airwolf	The Rival	
A Korean Odyssey	Call on Me	This is the deal O-gong makes with Seon-mi when she's little, before immediately stealing her memory of his name so she cannot actually call him. Once he gives the memory back, her being able to call him becomes a major element of the series (though weirdly gets retconned to be a result of the geumganggo, not the restored deal). Seon-mi later makes the deal in reverse, but this is never actually utilized.
Airwolf	Roaring Rampage of Revenge	Hawk does this full-on after Gabrielle dies due to Moffett’s torture of her. He plows through numerous Libyan tanks, aircraft, and surface-to-air missiles, then finally comes to a tense stand-off with Moffett, all while stoically not saying a word. Before Moffett can use his pistol in a near-miraculous, last-ditch attempt to bring down Airwolf, note Moffett had explained to a Lybian officer earlier in the episode Airwolf’s "weak point": a single bullet into the mid-air refueling intake.  Hawke unloads Airwolf’s ENTIRE remaining missile cache on him...even continuing to pull the trigger switch after all are depleted. Dom finally breaks Hawke out of his daze... "String......it's done."
Airwolf	Rule of Cool	It is not actually physically possible for a regular chopper to fly that fast. It gets a Hand Wave via dis-engaging blades and separate jet engines, and it even stays consistent; one episode has the system that handles this function damaged, and Dominic freaks out at the idea of going supersonic because the blades will rip off if they're still spinning. The aerial photography even changes to show which mode is in use, with camera trickery making the helicopter and the main rotor itself appear to be going appropriately slow or fast. It's also not possible for some of the missile types to fit inside the ADF pod.
Airwolf	Sequel Hook	The Video Will episode listed below ends with one of these, but nothing ever comes of it.
Airwolf	Shout-Out	
Airwolf	The Sociopath	Moffet. The only reason he does anything is for the fun of it, and people tend to die as a result.
Airwolf	Stock Footage	The first season didn't use any stock footage, and the later seasons used old shots quite rarely. Thanks to budget cuts, however, the use of recycled footage became truly obnoxious in the fourth season. The second season's "Flight #093 Is Missing" makes heavy use of footage from Airport'77 for its story of Caitlin having the misfortune to be a passenger of a flight that's hijacked and crashes into the ocean...
Airwolf	Super Prototype	Airwolf is a unique prototype helicopter with superior weapons to anything in the air.
Airwolf	Superior Successor	There were 2 helicopters made as an attempt to improve on the Airwolf. The HX-1 had the advantage of having side-mounted rocket launchers, so it can pump out more missiles than the Airwolf. Meanwhile there's the Redwolf which is a duplicate (or as much they can reproduce) of the "Lady" and then added a laser weapon capable of harming the Airwolf.
Airwolf	Suspiciously Similar Substitute	Saint John Hawke, a replacement for Stringfellow.
Airwolf	Theme Music Power-Up	in some cases, quite literally, the tune being sometimes played as Airwolf's engines are started up.
Airwolf	There Is No Kill Like Overkill	This is Hawke's usual operating procedure. He does try to avoid bloodshed when he can, and he gives enemies the chance to surrender whenever possible. But when he shoots, he doesn't just shoot to kill - he makes sure no one is walking away.
Airwolf	Too Dumb to Live	The Sheriff in "Sweet Britches" stands out. The Dirty Cop in that episode is overflown by an armed helicopter that blows out his windows, destroys two trucks and threatens to continue unless he releases his hostage. Mind you, he was facing life in prison or death row, but he would've at least had a chance to get away. While his cohorts had the sense to run out the back, he shot his own deputy and just keeps shooting.
Airwolf	Translation Convention	Largely averted.
Airwolf	Video Will	Despite being killed very, very dead in the pilot, Dr. Moffet managed to return as a villain in "Moffet's Ghost", using a twisted version of this trope.
Airwolf	Villainous Valor	Moffet again, at the end of the pilot, when he finds himself facing an enraged Stringfellow piloting Airwolf: he coolly tries to shoot a bullet into the chopper's refueling intake. Had he succeeded, it would have been a One-Hit Kill.
Airwolf	Waistcoat of Style	Archangel.
Airwolf	Weaponized Exhaust	In "Proof Through the Night", String uses the jet wash and turbulence from going supersonic to send a Soviet light chopper into a fatal spin. He also uses his jet wash to blow a truck on its side.
Airwolf	Weapons Understudies	
Airwolf	A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing	Invoked if not actually used. The design concept was a supersonic attack helicopter whose weapons were hidden in pods so it could pass as a fancy executive transport. The flight suits' shoulder patches even featured a Wolf In Sheep's Clothing design.
A Korean Odyssey	A Minor Kidroduction	The series starts with Seon-mi as a child, showing her struggles with ghosts and her first meeting with both Woo Hwi and O-gong, before it skips ahead to when she's an adult.
A Korean Odyssey	Animal Motifs	In keeping with their Journey to the West inspiration. Devil King Woo is a bull, Son O-gong is a monkey, Pal-Kye is a pig, Ms. Ma is a dog, etc. Only Pal-Kye was ever seen as the actual animal, but animal sound effects sometimes play for the appropriate character and they sometimes invoke their Animal Stereotypes (like Ma's Undying Loyalty).
A Korean Odyssey	Adopting the Abused	a Monster of the Week targets abused children in a tragically misguided attempt to give them better lives. When the heroes find out she just killed a little girl with an abusive father, they hurry to protect the girl's surviving brother. Jin Seon-mi's Locked Out of the Loop, Butt-Monkey assistant, Lee Han-ju, rises to the non-supernatural side of the occasion by physically rescuing the boy and adopting him.
A Korean Odyssey	Assassins Are Always Betrayed	Inverted. In the end, Kang Dae-sung's right hand man who helped organize his crimes (that didn't involve Asanyeo) reveals previously unknown loyalties and takes orders from someone else to dispose of Kang Dae-sung.
A Korean Odyssey	Bilingual Dialogue	When Seon-mi discovers that the ghost of the kimono-wearing child belongs to a Korean family loyal to Imperial Japan, the child and her family are speaking Japanese while Seon-mi speaks Korean and no one seems to have trouble understanding each other. Downplayed with Jonathan Lee, who often slips into English during conversations. Some characters seem to understand him while others don't.
A Korean Odyssey	Bittersweet Ending	The world has been saved and Seon-mi and O-gong finally know the truth of their mutual love. However, Seon-mi is dead, forcing O-gong to wait for her to reincarnate. Devil King Woo has finally found his son and starts to bond with him, but still can't reveal the truth. Pal-Kye has lost both Jung Se-ra and Jade Dragon, and with Summer Fairy gone as well, he has Survivor Guilt about a photo of the four of them. Han-ju has lost his boss that he had finally warmed up to, but inherits the business and will have a happy life with his family.
A Korean Odyssey	Bumbling Henchmen Duo	The two henchmen first introduced trying to bury Richie always show up together and vaguely resemble Moe and Curly Howard. However, while their reactions to the Outside-Context Problem they've found themselves dealing with are often comedic, they are shown to be perfectly capable of their deadly job.
A Korean Odyssey	Celestial Bureaucracy	Downplayed as we don't see most of the workings, but heavily implied. The stipulations of the Spiritual Realm are a backdrop to most characters' motivations or actions, whether to keep in line with them or to defy their binding proclamations.
A Korean Odyssey	Crime After Crime	Kang Dae-sung's first known crime was a legitimate accident he turned into a hit and run. Once Kang Dae-sung recruits Asanyeo she starts killing anyone in his way or who become suspicious of him. While it's implied it took the heroes to tip it over, it eventually becomes a Revealing Cover-Up as people notice when a reporter looking into the already mysterious and suspiciously convenient deaths himself turns up dead.
A Korean Odyssey	Continuity Creep	The series starts with an Evil Spirit of the Week format until Asanyeo is introduced, at which point it focuses on Asanyeo's grand designs that span multiple episodes at a time. The only normal evil spirit we see past that point is just used to establish how powerful Samjang has become.
A Korean Odyssey	Deal with the Devil	O-gong's initial deal with Seon-mi is portrayed this way. It seems like a good deal for both of them, but he steals part of her memory to prevent himself from having to make good on his end of the deal.
A Korean Odyssey	Double Standard: Rape, Sci-Fi	Once the geumganggo is placed on O-gong by Seon-mi he is magically compelled to love her. Seon-mi acknowledges the love is only because the geumganggo, and thus resolves to simply never take it off of him. This is never treated as particularly abusive (even when they have sex) and since he eventually discovers he grew to love her without it, the problem is never addressed.
A Korean Odyssey	Exact Words	Son O-gong promised to come if his name was called. Of course, this is entirely reliant on Seon-mi knowing his name. Furthermore is that he tells her that she will "never remember his name", indicating that she can't just be reminded of it, as his memory removal took away the possibility of her remembering it at all.
A Korean Odyssey	Fake Kill Scare	Devil King Woo accidentally kills Ms. Ma while trying to lash out at Master Subori. As it turns out, this was staged so that Subori would feel sympathy for Devil King and finally tell him what he wanted to know.
A Korean Odyssey	Foreshadowing	We're initially told that Seon-mi became Samjang as punishment for freeing O-gong from his prison, before its eventually revealed that she was Samjang since birth. This is actually set up from the very beginning, by the basic fact that Seon-mi being able to see ghosts was already unique and the reason she was recruited to visit O-gong's prison to begin with.
A Korean Odyssey	Forgotten Fallen Friend	After Asanyeo takes over Jung Se-ra's body, only Pal-Kye still seems to care about the fate of Jung Se-ra's soul. Even though O-gong had entered an Unstoppable Rage over Jung Se-ra's murderers shortly before her possession, Asanyeo is only ever treated as a villain to react to rather than someone they should actively pursue to save Jung Se-ra from. Especially notable when Asanyeo temporarily leaves Jung Se-ra's body. Pal-Kye taking care of her is relegated to a background element, and the rest of the heroes are perfectly fine with putting Asanyeo back into the body once they've saved Seon-mi, instead of taking the opportunity to let Jung Se-ra have her body back. When it's been so long that Jung Se-ra's soul is gone for good, it's treated as a Pal-Kye specific thing to mourn.
A Korean Odyssey	Grand Theft Me	Asanyeo beings herself back by taking Richie's body (eventually permanently) and has the goal of taking Seon-mi's body as a major goal.
A Korean Odyssey	Haunted Fetter	The gluttonous evil spirit seems to be more resilient than the spirits they have fought up until that point. They eventually realize it was born from and bound to a scale in the gym that symbolized the Weight Woe of everyone who used it. Once they destroy the scale, it defeats the evil spirit for good.
A Korean Odyssey	Homoerotic Subtext	Despite being in a female body for the majority of his screentime, Jade Dragon is male and seems to legitimately start to fall for Pal-Kye, culminating in sacrificing himself to save Pal-Kye in a scene that comes across strongly like a Dying Declaration of Love.
A Korean Odyssey	Hope Spot	The evil book seller spirit offers victims of child abuse a way into a magical world. As it turns out, it's just an illusion. When the girl leaves through her window to enter the world, she really does just fall and die. Only her soul is kidnapped and taken away.
A Korean Odyssey	Humans Are the Real Monsters	When Seon-mi first sees a vision of the future she must prevent, it involves military jets and bombs, not the evil spirits she had been dealing with up until that point. Ultimately it's revealed that the evil she must defeat is a spirit born of the collective evil of humanity brought about by a completely mundane politician.
A Korean Odyssey	Hypocrite	Seon-mi's cousin laments how her father treats Seon-mi, yet she and her husband are just as happy to demand money and blame her for everything because it's convenient. O-gong and Seon-mi eventually tell them both off and not to bother her anymore.
A Korean Odyssey	Hypocritical Humour	While discussing his plan to emotionally torture O-gong by setting up Jin with Jonathan, he talks about and demonstrates how he thinks O-gong would be hiding behind a pillar and gazing on pitifully like in a tv show. A few sentences later, he criticises Ms Ma's suggestion as an indication that she's been watching too many TV dramas.
A Korean Odyssey	Innocuously Important Episode	When Devil King Woo and Seon-mi enter an old film reel, the weight of the event mostly focuses on revealing information on Woo's old lover, with the evil spirit surviving the episode seeming more like a strange loose end. As it turns out, while the evil spirit themselves is never really important again, the secret scandal about a connection to Imperial Japan is a crucial element of the eventual Big Bad's arc.
A Korean Odyssey	It Sucks to Be the Chosen One	Being Samjang allows you to see ghosts unlike normal people, potentially causing you problems with interacting with other people. Evil spirits are also attracted to your blood, making you a danger magnet. Finally, it's revealed that the final fate of Samjang is to sacrifice yourself to save humanity from a great evil spirit.
A Korean Odyssey	Karma Houdini Warranty	After spending most of the series killing anyone who gets in his way and knowingly steering humanity into disaster, but being completely untouchable even with his scandals becoming public, Kang Dae-sung is deemed to have become a liability by his allies and is killed the same way he planned to do away with Jung Se-ra for good: sealed in Asanyeo's coffin and dumped into the sea.
A Korean Odyssey	Knight of Cerebus	The book seller spirit actually defeats Seon-mi for the first time and causes one of the first major present day deaths by killing a child. This is the first hint of the darker tone that soon follows with Asanyeo's freedom.
A Korean Odyssey	Lotus-Eater Machine	The evil book seller spirit traps the souls of children in worlds based on their favorite books.
Aishiteru	It's All My Fault	Satsuki and Seiko say this.
A Korean Odyssey	Love Triangle	Devil King Woo intentionally sets one up between Seon-mi, O-gong, and Jonathan in order to upset O-gong. It doesn't last very long as Jonathan recognizes the connection between the other two and ultimately respected Seon-mi as a hero, not a love interest.
A Korean Odyssey	Man, I Feel Like a Woman	Invoked as Pal-Kye keeps having to remind Jade Dragon to respect the body that he's possessing.
A Korean Odyssey	Missing Time	When Alice finally gets her body back, she reveals that she doesn't remember anything from the moment she first got possessed and is very confused about what she supposedly got up to during that time.
A Korean Odyssey	Modernized God	All of the monster and deity characters. Woo Hwi runs an entertainment business and is a judge on a popular idol series. Jeo Pal-kye makes a living as one of Woo Hwi's biggest stars. Sa O-jeong is publicly the CEO of a major mobile phone company. General Winter runs an ice cream shop and Summer Fairy runs a cocktail shop. Downplayed with O-gong, as while he is completely adapted to the modern world when it comes to culture and fashion, he has stayed apart from it.
A Korean Odyssey	Monkey King Lite	Sort of. Son O-gong literally is the Monkey King from Journey to the West.
A Korean Odyssey	My God, What Have I Done?	The evil book seller spirit is convinced they are actually a hero by saving children from abusive families. When it is pointed out that her actions kill them and hold them back from reincarnating, and that if she really wanted to have helped the children she could have addressed the abuse directly, she freaks out and becomes vulnerable to being destroyed.
A Korean Odyssey	My Grandson, Myself	Subverted. A photo of Woo Hwi from the past makes its rounds on the internet. He doesn't even bother claiming it's a relative because he knows that no one will really believe that the old photo depicts the same, unaging person as the CEO of a major modern entertainment company. Addressing the issue of starting a new identity becomes a plot point once he is "fatally" stabbed at a public event.
A Korean Odyssey	No Guy Wants to Be Chased	The target of a mermaid's affection found her too strange and clingy to return her affections. For some reason, he's treated as an example of humanity's evil by everyone for turning down her selfish obsession before it's revealed that he murdered her over it.
A Korean Odyssey	Not Even Human	An "evil" spirit of the week turns out to be the victim of a human. When she reverts to her original, inhuman form, the human feels absolved of his guilt. The heroes don't agree.
A Korean Odyssey	Our Ghosts Are Different	Only a few ghosts in the series are the spirit of dead humans. Most of the evil spirits they encounter are instead spawned as a result of the negative emotions or actions of humans, whether that be Weight Woe, Cyberbullying, Drunk Driving, or Child Abuse. In one notable case, an evil spirit turns out to be the ghost of a still living person, born from their absolute commitment to keeping a Dark Secret.
A Korean Odyssey	Palm Bloodletting	Seon-mi's usual way of drawing her own blood if she needs to get the attention of evil spirits is to slash herself across the palm.
A Korean Odyssey	Perverse Puppet	The first set of evil spirits are a couple of spirits possessing creepy puppets. Unlike most spirits, they cannot be destroyed without their bound object being destroyed.
A Korean Odyssey	Poor Communication Kills	Many of the characters have reasons to not entirely trust or even intentionally mislead each other. Even so, most secrets tend to come out by the end of the episode they're introduced in. The ones that aren't tend to fall into this, however. Some of the biggest include Richie not keeping anyone else informed about the men who seem to want her dead, which leads to essentially every bad outcome from then on, and O-gong and Seon-mi trying to keep each other safe from their destiny, which technically averts their destiny, but still literally gets one of them killed in a way they could have avoided if they were comparing notes.
A Korean Odyssey	Portal Picture	This series has two versions.
A Korean Odyssey	Redemption Failure	Played with. Devil King Woo starts the series having already undergone a Heel–Face Turn, but a major character element for him is the temptation to go back. The first major time is when O-gong tricks Woo into drinking some of Samjang's blood, bringing back his Horror Hunger urges. Ultimately Devil King Woo successfully resists each temptation and ends the series even having learned to appreciate his nemesis O-gong.
A Korean Odyssey	Reincarnation	A major element of the series. Most importantly, Samjang is an identity that reincarnates regularly to protect humanity. Woo Hwi's love is doomed to suffer in reincarnation after reincarnation as punishment for a past evil deed.
A Korean Odyssey	Retcon	O-gong is initially foiled in his attempt to eat Samjang because it turns out she's the girl who freed him and he made a deal with, meaning he still has to abide by his vow of protection. He eventually returns her memory, so she becomes able to utilize her end of the deal of actively summoning him for protection as well. However, the geumganggo is placed upon him at the same time, after which the explanation for these things suddenly changes. When curious about whether or not O-gong likes her independent of the geumganggo, she refuses to take it off because it's said that if he didn't like her without it, he would immediately kill her. Multiple characters reinforce this as the truth. Likewise, when other characters try to usurp this benefit, it is treated as a given that the geumganggo is also what allows her to summon him to her side, despite both of these originally being features of their deal. This creates a bit of a Catch-22 Dilemma Plot Hole about how she was able to survive long enough to get the geumganggo on him and activate it if it was the only reason he didn't eat her.
A Korean Odyssey	Sadistic Choice	The evil spirit in the gym tries this against Seon-mi and O-gong, possessing an innocent bystander and forcing them to either let the spirit go or kill the innocent bystander along with the spirit. Seon-mi immediately Takes a Third Option, exploiting her Supernaturally Delicious and Nutritious nature to compel the evil spirit to leave the person's body of its own free will so they can defeat it cleanly.
A Korean Odyssey	Screw Destiny	Played with. Once they realize that what rang for Seon-mi was a death bell and not a love bell, both Seon-mi and O-gong do everything they can to avoid having to kill the other. Ultimately they succeed, but Seon-mi still dies in the process of saving the world.
A Korean Odyssey	Seeing Through Another's Eyes	Asanyeo conspires to link Devil King Woo with a zombie she animated in order to convince him that she has found his son. As a result, he gets visions of the zombie's perspective as it kills.
A Korean Odyssey	Shoo Out the Clowns	Pal-Kye starts the series as a bit of a Butt-Monkey and Richie's amnesia and rotted body make her a bit of a Cloudcuckoolander. The series starts to get serious once Richie's body is hijacked, and while Pal-Kye stays around, the trauma of losing Richie takes his comedic side with her.
A Korean Odyssey	Sliding Scale of Adaptation Modification	A Korean Odyssey sits in a strange place in relation to Journey to the West. The relationships between certain characters (like the lingering animosity between O-gong and Woo, and Woo's past as a villain) imply that the story is a sequel to Journey to the West, but it repeats enough character and story beats to make it either an Adaptation Inspiration with a Setting Update or a Same Plot Sequel.
A Korean Odyssey	Supernaturally Delicious and Nutritious	Samjang's blood is nearly irresistible to supernatural creatures. Evil spirits are constantly after Seon-mi due to it, O-gong initially wants to convince her to die because of it, and Woo Hwi finds himself having to resist the temptation on and off throughout the series.
A Korean Odyssey	Then Let Me Be Evil	When Pal-kye finds out that Asanyeo is helping the man who killed Richie to begin with, even he finally turns on her. She almost says this trope word for word in the translation and starts by attempting to kill Pal-kye. Of course, the only reason everyone was treating her that way was because she had already proven herself untrustworthy, she just decided it was never her fault until that point.
A Korean Odyssey	The Redeemer	Pal-Kye starts out being nice to Asanyeo for the sake of Jung Se-ra. At some point, he apparently realized that Jung Se-ra's spirit had moved on, but kept being nice to Asanyeo. It seemed to be working, too, until he found out she had crossed what he considered a Moral Event Horizon, in turn triggering her Then Let Me Be Evil moment. Even still, at the end, she came to him in order to find some sort of redemption in death.
A Korean Odyssey	Troll	Seon-mi is embarrassed in front of her whole class when she obeys the teacher's instructions, only to realize that the teacher is an evil spirit that only she can see and hear, and seemingly only masqueraded as the teacher just to troll her.
A Korean Odyssey	Two Siblings In One	General Winter and Summer Fairy are eventually revealed to be siblings with Summer Fairy sharing General Winter's body.
A Korean Odyssey	What Happened to the Mouse?	The second half of the series quickly stops showing many of the side and background characters, some of which had previously contributed to Running Gags, like Devil King's fellow judges or the parking lot attendant
Alatriste	Adaptational Badass	
Alatriste	Adaptational Dumbass	Luis de Alquézar gets hit hard, as in this series, Angélica is shown to be the (only) brain of the family. Her book version was implied to assist occasionally her uncle's schemes, but he was a mastermind in his own right without any input from her part.
Alatriste	Adaptational Jerkass	This version of Angélica engages explicitly in animal cruelty, which is never shown or even implied in the books.
Alatriste	Adaptational Wimp	
Alatriste	Adaptation Expansion	In the series, Angélica receives much more characterization than in any of the books, though only in exchange for turning her from a smart Fille Fatale to a saturday morning cartoon villain who gets tooled even by Íñigo himself.
Alatriste	Adaptation Personality Change	
Alatriste	Adaptation Relationship Overhaul	
Alatriste	Ascended Extra	
Alatriste	Canon Foreigner	Asunta, Dorotea and other characters were created for the series.
Alatriste	Composite Character	This series's version of Juan Vicuña has elements of the graduate Calzas, another friend to Alatriste who gets Adapted Out.
Alatriste	Denser and Wackier	
Alatriste	Fat Bastard	Asunta, Angélica's fat, devious chambermaid.
Alatriste	Fille Fatale	Angélica promises Íñigo a reward for helping her, only that she denies it will be money, and it's instead implied, judging from her non-verbal language and her personality in the books, that this is suggestion of sexual favors. This is a particularly daring instance of this, however, as she is 14 years old and he looks even younger.
Alatriste	Hell-Bent for Leather	Alatriste's anachronistic leather jacket, which also cramps Red Is Heroic.
Alatriste	Lighter and Softer	The series has a ton of comedic relief and lacks the blood and cynism of the books.
Alatriste	Wrestler in All of Us	Quevedo busts out a good ol' chokeslam to throw a mook from a staircase.
Alatriste	Voodoo Shark	The thick native accent of Ukrainian actress Natasha Yarovenko, cast as Madrid's top theatre actress María de Castro, was handwaved as this version of Castro being from Flanders. And that was it. There was never an explanation to why a Flemish woman was named María de Castro, how she became a successful leading theatre actress in Madrid despite having a thick foreign accent, or why that accent was Ukrainian instead of Flemish.
Alcatraz	Air-Vent Passageway	Rebecca uses a air vent to sneak into a bank during a hostage situation in "Cal Sweeney".
Alcatraz	The Alcatraz	Both the titular prison and the new Alcatraz prison that the federal government built specifically to house captured "63"'s.
Alcatraz	Anti-Villain	The first inmate to show up, Jack Sylvane, skirts the edge of this with his sympathetic backstory. After serving in World War II, he got sent to federal prison for robbing a grocery store to feed his family due to the fact it sold stamps, which legally made it a post office. Then he killed a man in the showers for attempting to rape him, which got him sent to Alcatraz where E.B. Tiller messed with him apparently For the Lulz. On top of that, his wife divorced him to marry his brother.
Alcatraz	Asshole Victim	Johnny McKee's m.o. involves targeting these. Unfortunately he doesn't much care if Innocent Bystanders get killed, too.
Alcatraz	Big Bad	By the end of the first season, it would appear that  Warden James is the one behind the disappearances and returns.
Alcatraz	Black-and-Grey Morality	Hauser's organization seems to exist solely to recapture 256 of the worst criminals the country's ever known. Except Hauser is the same kind of asshole who gets off on torturing prisoners. He's willing to put innocent lives in danger in order to insure that he can capture the "63s" - as in, Kit Nelson is a serial child murderer whose M.O. is kidnapping his victims from their beds on a Friday, messing with their heads for the next 48 hours, then putting their bodies back where he found them on Sunday. Hauser's solution? Send the police away and grab Nelson when he delivers the body.
Alcatraz	Cliffhanger	The end of the first season is this, ending with Rebecca on the operating table and flatlining. Whoops, make that the end of the series.
Alcatraz	Cool and Unusual Punishment	Loud of War: The warden of Alcatraz comes up with a unique punishment for Ernest Cobb, who deliberately got himself thrown in solitary because he hates people talking. He lets Cobb stay in solitary indefinitely, but  puts another inmate who can't shut up in the same cell as him.
Aishiteru	Mama Didn't Raise No Criminal	Satsuki's total denial in the first two episodes.
Alcatraz	Dangerously Close Shave	In "Cal Sweeney", the prison barber accidentally cuts Tiller while Tiller is demanding a cut of Sweeney's racket. The barber's reaction shows he expects some retribution from Tiller, but Tiller uses the cut as an opportunity to deliver a veiled threat to Sweeney about what happens if you shave against the grain.
Alcatraz	Deadly Prank	Johnny McKee was the victim of a nasty prank in high school that ended with a firecracker exploding between his legs and castrating him. He started killing people as revenge.
Alcatraz	The Dog Bites Back	As deputy warden of Alcatraz, E.B. Tiller made Jack Sylvane's time on the Rock a living hell, one example being when he planted a screwdriver in Sylvane's cell so he could send him to solitary, making him miss a visit from his wife. Upon reappearing in 2012, his first act is to track down the now elderly Tiller and stab him to death.
Alcatraz	Even Evil Has Standards	Kit Nelson was a constant target of the other inmates, the guards, and the warden, due to his status as a child killer.
Alcatraz	Exposition of Immortality	The character of Lucy was just a minor character working on the special task force investigating the reappearing criminals who disappeared from Alcatraz Island several decades before, but a flashback revealed her working as a psychiatrist in the 60s on Alcatraz Island. A single video of her known to have been taken in the 60s is the one clue to the other characters of her true age.
Alcatraz	Flawless Token	Clarence Montgomery is the sole black inmate the team goes after, and he's not just less evil than some of the other maniacs in Alcatraz, he's a completely innocent man who was railroaded because he fell in love with a white woman.
Alcatraz	Genius Bruiser	Garrett Stillman, who's explicitly mentioned as having an IQ that was "off the charts".
Alcatraz	Grave Robbing	Paxton Petty stole Silver Star medals from the graves of dead soldiers to use as shrapnel in his landmines.
Alcatraz	Honorary Uncle	Ray to Rebecca.  Subverted when we find out he's actually Tommy Madsen's brother, which makes him Rebecca's great uncle by blood.
Alcatraz	Hypocrite	Hauser: I want him alive, I want them all captured alive! Doc: He does realize he's the only one who shoots them, right?
Alcatraz	Idiosyncratic Episode Naming	Every episode is named after the 63er that has to be caught in the episode.
Alcatraz	Jerkass	Emerson Hauser, E.B. Tiller, and the Warden. It looks like Alcatraz in the 1960s just naturally attracted sadists to work as guards.
Alcatraz	Jerk with a Heart of Gold	Hauser has his moments, like near the end of "Guy Hastings", where he lets Guy see (if not speak to) his daughter and grandchildren, and apologizing for what's happened to him. Also,  in regards to Lucy, Hauser seems to soften up quite a bit. Understandable, since they were romantically involved prior to the disappearances.
Alcatraz	Jurisdiction Friction	
Alcatraz	Land Mine Goes "Click!"	"Paxton Petty" is all about this, as Petty uses land mines as his primary weapon. Hauser steps on a mine Petty planted on the beach, hears it go click, and has to stand there for several hours until Rebecca and Soto realise that he is missing.
Alcatraz	Left Hanging	The final episode ended with Rebecca having been shot and seemingly dying on the operating table, and no indication what would happen to the 63s who were still at large.
Alcatraz	Loophole Abuse	
Alcatraz	Luke, I Am Your Father	It's revealed at the end of the first episode that Rebecca's grandfather was one of the first returned inmates, and was actually the person who killed her first partner to shake her off. She seems more intrigued than anything else though.
Alcatraz	Mad Bomber	Paxton Petty was a Korean War vet who felt betrayed by the government and started planting land mines in San Francisco. He even uses a landmine as a grenade.
Alcatraz	Madness Mantra	Cobb recites one when he performs his shootings.Cobb: There are 47 slats in the picket fence. 4-7. 1-2-3-4. 1-2-3-4. 4-7. (ad infinitum)
Alcatraz	The Masquerade	The US federal government, unwilling to disclose that the most successful prison break in recorded history occurred in 1963, released an official explanation for the closing of Alcatraz and created fake transfers to other prisons (signed by Robert Kennedy himself), then later issued fake death certificates saying they all died at the prisons they were transferred to.
Alcatraz	Manchild	Hauser notes that Dr. Soto displays clear signs of arrested development, which is later revealed to be due to being kidnapped when he was 11.
Alcatraz	Manipulative Bastard	The MO of Cal Sweeney. He seduces bank tellers to get to the safety deposit boxes.
Alcatraz	Mirroring Factions	The "63's" tend to be vicious yet sympathetic criminals. The guards of the time and the group hunting them down in the present are protecting society in doing so, but are prone to casual sadism. The key theme of the series seems to be the similarities between criminals and those who hunt and/or punish them. The inmates appear to be pitiful wrecks with Freudian Excuses, often deserving of execution, but the dehumanizing treatment they received at the hands of its staff has not lessened the threat they pose to society but increased it. The guards appear to be sadistic monsters who have simply chosen a profession that permits them to practice their sadism in a socially acceptable manner. Whether or not this is Truth in Television has yet to be decided, but there is controversial evidence to support this theory.
Alcatraz	Mugged for Disguise	In "Garrett Stillman", Stillman hijacks an armoured car and steals the guards' uniforms, leaving them in an alleyway in their underwear.
Alcatraz	No Celebrities Were Harmed	Ernest Cobb is suspiciously similar to Charles Whitman. While they ultimately differ in characterization, motive, and methods the inspiration is clear and the allusion seems intentional (as opposed to unintentionally just using now stock traits) when it is stated that Cobb killed 16 people, as Whitman did in real life.
Alcatraz	An Offer You Can't Refuse	When Warden James asks Tommy Madsen to work for him, it's not really something Tommy can refuse.
Alcatraz	Oh, Crap!	Rebecca gets a decent one in when Paxton Petty rolls a mine he just activated in her direction.
Alcatraz	Outliving One's Offspring	Tommy Madsen outlived his son Van, Rebecca's father.
Alcatraz	Pariah Prisoner	Kit Nelson is beaten by a mob of prisoners in the yard because of his status as a child murderer. He's put into solitary confinement by the guards partly for his safety, and partly as punishment.
Alcatraz	Pay Evil unto Evil	Emerson Hauser, E.B. Tiller, and the Warden appear to be sadists who found a socially acceptable outlet for their habits.
Alcatraz	Prank Date	In "Johnny McKee", one of these provides the motivation for McKee's mass murder attacks.
Alcatraz	Prisons Are Gymnasiums	In "Sonny Burnett'', Sonny uses his time in solitary to toughen up.
Alcatraz	Rage Breaking Point	Sylvane already hated Tiller immensely for abusing him during his time as Alcatraz's deputy warden, but what finally motivates him to kill Tiller is learning that during his stint as an FBI agent in the decades after leaving Alcatraz he was awarded the Medal of Valor, an award a sadist like Tiller should never have gotten. Considering Sylvane is a World War II veteran, he no doubt knew lots of men far more deserving of such a medal.
Alcatraz	The Reveal	
Alcatraz	The Rival	In the sixties, Beauregard to  Lucy.
Alcatraz	Roaring Rampage of Revenge	Johnny McKee was a victim of bullying in high school which culminated in a Deadly Prank that seriously injured him. As revenge he killed most of his classmates. While he initially only wanted to kill 'bullies', he escalates to killing people who are rude to him and then to just killing complete strangers.
Alcatraz	Screw the Rules, I Make Them!	It's entirely possible that Ernest Cobb would have happily spent the rest of his life at Alcatraz in solitary, a threat to no-one... except the warden found it necessary to screw with him until he completely lost his mind, just so he could call in Lucille Sengupta, AKA Lucy Banerjee for some as-of-yet undisclosed purpose.
Alcatraz	Serial Killings, Specific Target	Cobb is a variartion on this. He is a serial killer, but at each kill he shoots a number of random people as 'noise' to mask his true choice of target.
Alcatraz	Shout-Out	
Alcatraz	Smug Snake	Sonny Burnett. He entered prison as a scared, rather pathetic kidnapper and subsequently reinventing himself into a musclebound badass through sheer force of will. But his assertion that the cops would "never" find his latest kidnap victim, followed in short order by them doing exactly that, proves he's still not much of a criminal.
Alcatraz	Theme Serial Killer	
Alcatraz	Thicker Than Water	Subverted when Rebecca finally confronts her grandfather:Tommy: I'm your blood.Rebecca: And you thinks that makes us family?
Alcatraz	Took a Level in Jerkass	Hauser, noted by Lucy who worries how much he's changed since she knew him in '63  Lucy: Try not to shoot anyone!
Alcatraz	Trauma Conga Line	Jack Sylvane's entire life basically comes down to a long series of these.
Alcatraz	Unresolved Sexual Tension	Averted. Rebecca and Doc are the typical female/male investigative duo that almost universally results in this, but they don't appear to have any romantic interest in each other.
Alcatraz	Vancouver Doubling	Besides, it would be too crazy to even think to have an underground lair within The Rock, let alone produce a TV series there. Local officials, while benefiting from the commerce of tourists due to the popularity of the show, have noted on site that this show is a work of fiction. There are others who think differently.
Alcatraz	Wardens Are Evil	
Alcatraz	What the Hell, Hero?	Hauser is the target of this constantly. He deserves it, too.
Alcatraz	You Are Number Six	The prisoners tend to be known by their prisoner number rather than their names; the Deputy Warden in particular made a concerted effort in never referring to prisoners by their name. Tommy Madsen specifically introduces himself by number when he's introduced to keep The Reveal that he's Rebecca's grandfather secret a little longer.
Alcatraz	You Have Outlived Your Usefulness	Garrett Stillman was once betrayed by his partner in crime so now he gets rid of all his accomplices after they have fulfilled their role. He's also the victim of this trope, c/o Tommy Madsen.
Akavet	Aerith and Bob	"Alma" and "Elias" are extremely common Generation Z names in Denmark, and "Aske" is also relatively common... but "Tone" as a name is almost unheard of.
Akavet	Ambiguously Bi	
Akavet	Annoying Younger Sibling	Silke is constantly cheeky and rude towards Elias, meddles in his affairs and often shows him No Sympathy.
Akavet	Beauty Is Never Tarnished	The gross-out part of the trope is very much averted with Alma. It's a Running Gag that she vomits very easily, and there's even a whole episode focusing on her attempt to save face while shitting on the school toilet.
Akavet	Beta Couple	Sofie and Carl serve as this to Alma and Elias in season 2. They get together with a lot less hesitation than Alma and Elias did, and their relationship seems to have a lot less drama (in fact, the only falling out they have is directly caused by Alma's Operation: Jealousy).
Akavet	Casanova Wannabe	Elias talks a big game, but when he actually approaches girls, they are often grossed out by his immature and male-chauvinistic behavior (though his self-confidence occasionally makes him more attractive to girls than the insecure Aske).
Akavet	Caught with Your Pants Down	
Akavet	Cringe Comedy	Naturally a stable trope for a series titled "Awkward". Almost every episode has the characters deal with things such as unwanted erections, period leaks and clumsy attempts to approach your crush.
Akavet	Demoted to Extra	
Akavet	Divergent Character Evolution	At the start of season 1, Sofie and Sara only ever appear together and are both known as the popular and snobbish girls of the class. However, once they start interacting with the main cast separately, they are shown to have different personalities; Sofie is the most outgoing and overbearing one, while Sara is more soft-spoken and sometimes a bit shy.
Akavet	Flanderization	AC is introduced as an Occidental Otaku who happens to also like cats. After some episodes, her fondness of cats grows to an obsession and becomes her defining trait, with her interest in manga and anime only coming up rarely. The cat-eared headband she wears also goes from being a homage to Cat Girls in anime to being a homage to actual cats.
Akavet	Guilt by Association Gag	Sif kicks out Tone, Alma and Elias from her party - Tone for playing with her feelings, Alma for stealing her swimsuit, and Elias for puking on the floor. And then she demands for Aske to leave the party as well even though he did nothing wrong - just because he's part of the same friend group as those three.
Akavet	Hippie Parents	Elias's parents are revealed to be these in season 3 - being spiritual-minded oddballs who are completely casual about sex and alcohol.
Akavet	Hypocritical Heartwarming	Aske and Alma never seem to get along in most of season 1; they spend a lot of their time together bickering and are implied to have become less close with age. However, when Elias starts dating Alma, Aske becomes extremely protective of her.
Akavet	Jerk with a Heart of Gold	All of the four main characters can - as typical hormonal teenagers - be incredibly selfish, surly and insensitive, but they are consistently shown to be good people at heart and usually come around for their friends. Elias is more openly jovial than the other three, but on the flipside he's also the most sexist and conceited one.
Aishiteru	Manly Tears	Both Kazuhiko and Hideaki end up crying.
Akavet	Lipstick Lesbian	Tone is a downplayed example - she's not overly girly, but she does have several Bratty Teenage Daughter traits and she never shows any of the stereotypically butch traits associated with lesbians. The same applies to her (ex-)girlfriend Sif, minus the Bratty Teenage Daughter traits.
Akavet	Love at First Sight	Aske becomes infatuated with Trine from the moment she enters the classroom, and Sonja from the moment she enters the gym. With Sara, it at least takes a kiss from her for Aske to get interested in her, though he still crushes on her before actually getting to know her.
Akavet	My Sister Is Off-Limits	Despite never having shown to care much about Alma at first, Aske suddenly becomes protective of her when Elias starts dating her, and has a falling out with Elias. It takes a long time before he starts to accept their relationship.
Akavet	Only Known by Their Nickname	Ollie and Julle are mentioned during their first appearances to be named "Oliver" and "Julie" respectively, but they're only ever called Ollie and Julle.
Akavet	Only Known by Initials	Silke's classmate AC.
Akavet	Parent with New Paramour	After being single for several years, Tone's dad starts dating a woman by the end of season 1... Just too bad for Tone that the woman in question is her biology teacher.
Akavet	Raging Stiffie	A Running Gag is that this is one of Aske's recurring problems. The second episode specifically focuses on an unwanted erection of his, but the problem also comes up in other episodes. For some reason, it seems to only affect Aske and not the other teenage boys.
Akavet	Real Life Writes the Plot	Alma wears braces during the first half of season 1 because her actress wears braces (and it fits well with the character's awkwardness). When her actress had her braces removed midway during filming, the writing team decided to quickly write an episode where Alma also has her braces removed and deals with the (lack of) attention from it.
Akavet	Relationship Revolving Door	Alma and Elias go through this after becoming an Official Couple. At the end of season 1, they are on the verge of breaking up because of Elias not being able to read Alma's signals. In season 2, they break up for real due to Alma's Operation: Jealousy, but get together again a few episodes later. In season 3, they break up again at the start of the season due to Elias's refusal to talk about Their First Time, and this time it's permanent.
Akavet	The Talk	
Akavet	Teacher/Student Romance	Aske immediately becomes smitten with Trine, the new biology teacher, and this leads to some awkward incidents in the following episodes. However, once Sara kisses him on the camp trip, he quickly gets over Trine and focuses his attention on Sara instead.
Akavet	Wild Teen Party	Alma's and Aske's birthday party ends up as one of these, with lots of alcohol, dancing, loud music, flirting, several people vomiting, and Thor making out with a picture. It culminates with Elias trying to light fireworks inside the living room, though he's interrupted in the last moment by Alma's and Aske's parents getting home.
Aishiteru	Accidental Murder	What happened between Kiyotaka and Tomoya was basically a children's fight gone horribly out of hand.
Aishiteru	All of the Other Reindeer	Life isn't easy for Satsuki and Kazuhiko after their son is found guilty. They have to quit their jobs, move from their house and struggle to find new homes and places to work. Worse, people vandalize their door every time they find out Satsuki and Kazuhiko are Tomoya's parents.
Aishiteru	Babies Make Everything Better	Sort of: Satsuki and Kazuhiko choose to have another child to make sure Tomoya grasps the enormity of taking a life away. Seeing his baby brother, Tomoya finally cries and says to Kiyotaka he's sorry.
Aishiteru	Be Careful What You Wish For	Mihoko wished for her brother to disappear, and then he died.
Aishiteru	Cassandra Truth	The day of the tragedy, Satsuki asks Tomoya what he was doing that day, and he tells her he killed someone. She didn't believe him.
Aishiteru	Children Are Innocent	Averted: Tomoya isn't an evil boy, but he kills Kiyotaka. And Kiyotaka wasn't the little angel everyone thought.
Aishiteru	Children Raise You	Sort of: Because of their children (and the tragedy) all the parents in the story grow and mature.
Aishiteru	Convicted by Public Opinion	While Tomoya is guilty, his parents did nothing wrong. It doesn't stop people from role them out of society.
Aishiteru	Crazy Homeless Lady	Averted: The old lady is quite sympathetic, but she's deeply unstable and dangerous for a child.
Aishiteru	Death Is a Sad Thing	part of the plot is having Tomoya to really understand this.
Aishiteru	Death of a Child	Kiyotaka is found dead in the first episode.
Aishiteru	Despair Event Horizon	OK, one family has a son which got killed, the other a son which killed.
Aishiteru	Determinator	Nothing will stop Mrs. Tomita from discovering what happened between Tomoya and Kiyotaka and helping their families. Nothing.
Aishiteru	Deus Angst Machina	Seriously, every time things are going slighty better for someone, something happens to put him back to square one.
Aishiteru	Disproportionate Retribution	Kiyotaka was really rude, but he was a 7-year-old boy and didn't deserve death.
Aishiteru	Dramatic Shattering	The Noguchi family photo. Instead of changing the glass, Satsuki puts duct tape on it.
Aishiteru	Dysfunction Junction	Well, Satsuki fails to notice Tomoya's trauma to the point that the kid has a breakdown where he killed another boy, while Kazuhiko is an absent husband and father. Seiko and Hideaki spoil Kiyotaka so much that their daughter thinks they don't love her.
Aishiteru	Freudian Excuse	Tomoya had a very traumatic experience that he blamed himself for. Satsuki didn't notice, and Tomoya stopped trusting her (and everyone else), but still thought that it was his fault in the first place and felt guilty for the whole situation. After six months in this circle, Kiyotaka tells him his mother doesn't love him 'cause he's weird, and Tomoya snaps.
Aishiteru	Good Parents	It doesn't help: One single mistake, and their life is destroyed forever.
Aishiteru	Heroic BSoD	Seiko after Kiyotaka's death, until her family snaps her out of it. Satsuki after Mihoko tells her to die. Basically every character has at least one.
Aishiteru	Innocent Inaccurate	Tomoya doesn't understand the gravity of his action, and his narration mirrors that.
Aishiteru	Insane Equals Violent	Tomoya beats Kiyitaka to death.
Aishiteru	Intergenerational Friendship	Mrs. Tomita and Tomoya (even if it's her work, it's clear that she really cares about the boy, and vice versa). Tomoya and the old homeless lady also have one, but it ends badly.
Aishiteru	Ironic Echo	When Satsuki tries to get Tomoya to say he's not the killer, she tells him he has a mouth to speak. Tomoya's response is that she has ears to listen.
Aishiteru	Parents as People	Seiko and Hideaki are so grieving for Kiyotaka's death that Mihoko starts thinking that it would be better if she was dead instead and that her presence (and life) makes no difference to her parents. They don't notice until the girl's teacher told them Mihoko wants to quit school and she has a breakdown when confronted about it. Satsuki fails to notice the moment Tomoya needs her the most.
Aishiteru	Put on a Bus	Ayano goes to Africa
Aishiteru	Redemption Earns Life	Sort of: Seiko wants Tomoya to have a long, full life and be happy to see what he took away from Kiyotaka.
Aishiteru	There Are No Therapists	Mrs. Tomita is extremely competent and menage to support Kiyotaka's family, Tomoya's mother and Tomoya... but still her role is to find out what happened, not supporting destroyed people.
Aishiteru	Tragic Mistake	If only Satsuki has asked to Tomoya what was wrong when he come home soaked instead of scolding him; if only Seiko wasn't 15 minutes late that day; if only Kazuhiko had taught Tomoya to play catchball...
AJ And The Queen	Act of True Love	AJ gets a puppy after Ruby buys it off from a homeless couple and is ecstatic. However, upon seeing that the puppy was always crying at night and is refusing to eat, she decides to give it back to its old owners, though it's not easy for her. This is especially noteworthy since she was whining about wanting a dog of her own in past episodes, but she loves dogs too much to see them unhappy.
AJ And The Queen	Actor Allusion

AJ And The Queen	The Cameo	Alumni of RuPaul's Drag Race appear throughout the series as various drag queens Ruby encounters on the road. Some of them include Katya, Valentina, and Bianca Del Rio.

AJ And The Queen	Latin Lover	Hector/Damien puts on this persona when grifting Ruby.
AJ And The Queen	Left Hanging	Due to the show's cancellation, the possibility that AJ is now resenting her mother for lying about Pop Pop's existence and Hector/Damien coming to the realization that he might have genuinely loved Ruby may never be explored.

Air City	The Bet	Staffers at Incheon start taking bets on just who Do-kyung is when she arrives at Incheon and is noticed by security. The top choice is that she's a spy.
Air City	Counterfeit Cash	A story arc that starts with episode 10 has NIS tracking a Russian bad guy, who is part of a team smuggling counterfeit American dollars through Incheon. Eventually it's revealed that the actual plot is to take the counterfeit $10 million and switch it out with ten million real dollars being sent to the Incheon airport bank for currency conversion.
Air City	Conspicuous Trenchcoat	The guy who comes to the airport in episode 2 to meet the murderer who faked a heart attack (and his nattily dressed handler) wears a very conspicuous trenchcoat, but Ji-sung still fails to spot him.
Air City	What Did I Do Last Night?	In episode 4 Mr. Eum, the custodian staff supervisor, brings Ji-sung home from a night of drinking, and invites Ji-sung to rent a room in his house. He was so drunk that the next morning he's forgotten all about it, accusing his niece Nan-young of bringing Ji-sung home and saying that she is a blackout drunk.
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	Air-Vent Passageway	A laundry chute is used as this in "Das Versprechen".
Air City	Cowboy Cop	Technically Ji-sung is an intelligence agent and not a cop, but he is basically this trope straight, being an impulsive hothead with a habit of conducting unauthorized investigations. In episode 2, the killer who faked a collapse in episode 1 has been spotted. Ji-sung gives chase, but he gets to a checkpoint that he can't get past because he is not actually part of airport security. So instead of letting airport security handle it, he leaps over the gate and goes chasing after the bad guy, while security chases after him.Police commissioner: Are you always reckless, spontaneous, and violent?

Air City	Discreet Drink Disposal	In episode 5, Ye-won has finally badgered Ha-joon into a date. She is drinking heavily while Ha-joon isn't interested in drinking—he's pumping her for information about the mysterious top-secret patient in the airport hospital. So when she insists he take a shot, Ha-joon says "Look over there!", and throws his drink over his shoulder when her back is turned.
Air City	Dramatic Gun Cock	Sun-woo holding Ji-sung hostage at the beginning of episode 14 does this, presumably to be a little scarier.
Air City	Faux Fluency	In episode 14, Sun-woo briefly switches to English when talking to Ji-sung; he grew up in the USA and says English is more natural. The actor delivers this dialogue in a stilted manner with a heavy accent and it's perfectly clear he's a native Korean speaker.
Air City	Finger-Twitching Revival	How the suspicious character who collapsed on the plane wakes up in the first episode. Subverted in that he was faking the whole time.
Air City	Glasses Pull	The mastermind behind the steal-the-money plot does this at the end of episode 12, shooting a Death Glare at the airport security agents behind him, as he realizes the jig is up.
Air City	Grave-Marking Scene	In episode 2 Ji-sung, deeply troubled about the guy who probably killed his partner getting away, goes to a memorial site for NIS agents killed in action.
Air City	Hey, You!	Ji-sung gets irritated when the police commissioner speaks informally to him in episode 2, saying "Don't drop the honorifics on me! It's annoying!"
Air City	High Heel Hurt	Do-kyung is apparently bothered by her high heels as she's going to work, so she takes them off and starts walking across the airport concourse in her stocking feet. Ji-sung catches her, and it's a humanizing moment for the uptight Do-kyung.
Air City	How They Treat the Help	Ha-joon seems to know all the airport staff personally, chatting up the runway workers (and changing out a couple of runway lights himself when he notices one of the workers has a sprained ankle) and asking a lady who's collecting cardboard for recycling when her son is getting married. This becomes plot relevant in the second episode, when his familiarity with the staff causes him to realize that one of them's an impostor (the bad guy who escaped the hospital in the first episode).
Air City	I Was Never Here	Ji-sung is suspended from the NIS but goes to Hong Kong anyway to catch the bad guy who set up Do-kyung. After the NIS has defeated the bad guys at the end of episode 8, he tells Ha-joon, as he's leaving, "You never saw me in Hong Kong."
Air City	Karaoke Box	In episode 3, Ha-joon gets senior airport staff to welcome Do-kyung by taking everyone out for a night of drinking. It of course ends with people singing karaoke.

Air City	Parking Garage	In episode 4 Charlie Wei the gangster kidnaps Do-kyung in the airport and drags her to the parking garage. Ji-sung chases them there and starts shooting, and Wei crashes his car.
Air City	Percussive Pickpocket	Ji-sung is able to lift the suspect's passport in the first episode by bumping into him, as they pass on the way to the airplane's toilet.
Air City	The Place	"Air City", aka Incheon.
Air City	Shout-Out	In episode 3 Do-kyung asks Ji-sung why he joined the NIS in the first place. Ji-sung answers that he once saw Robert Redford in a movie where Redford was a CIA agent, and Redford looked cool.
Air City	Sinister Switchblade	One of the gangbangers Ji-sung is brawling with in episode 15 draws a switchblade and flicks it open, but Ji-sung still wins the fight.
Air City	Title Drop	During her big presentation with the airline executive in episode 15, Do-kyung refers to the new version of Incheon, after expansion and modernization, as "Air City".
Air City	The Triads and the Tongs	
Air City	Turn in Your Badge	Do-kyung gets arrested by whoever the Korean equivalent of the DEA is, after her "friend" gives her a pair of sneakers with some drugs hidden inside. In episode 7, Ji-sung confronts the drug cops about this, loses his temper, and punches one. For this he has to turn in his badge and is suspended from the NIS.
Air City	Unlucky Childhood Friend	As it turns out, Ha-joon knew Do-kyung and her sister when they were all schoolchildren together. Do-kyung puts him permanently in the friend zone, as she has fallen for Ji-sung.
Air City	Vacation Episode	In episode 9 the senior staff of the airport take a team-bonding retreat to a scenic island. Ha-joon makes the ill-considered decision to book them a vacation on the very island where Ji-sung is sitting out his NIS suspension (and healing from his stab wound). This results in Ji-sung and Do-kyung's first kiss and (apparently, it's hard to tell with a Korean Drama) the consummation of their relationship.
Air City	"Wanted!" Poster	In episode 2 airport security is distributing wanted posters of the mystery man who killed a nurse and escaped from the airport clinic in episode 1.
Alchemy Of Souls	Unlucky Childhood Friend	Seo Yul to Naksu.
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	Always on Duty	Semir and his partners, usually.
Alex And Co	Adults Are Useless	The protagonists' parents barely do anything to help them with their problems. Alex actually calls out his parents on paying attention only to his brother Joe and not even knowing that a record label offered Alex's band a contract.
Alex And Co	Aerith and Bob	Averted. All main characters have fairly common names, even generic enough to be used as Alice and Bob- style hypothetical names.
Alex And Co	Arc Words	"Together Forever" for Alex and Nicole. Each of them wears a bracelet with one of these words, and in the special episodes, they get new versions of them. The words are a symbol of their special relationship.
Alex And Co	Blonde, Brunette, Redhead	Rebecca (and her sister Giada in season 3), Linda and Samantha respectively.
Alex And Co	Five-Man Band	A variation of the actual musical band type:
Alex And Co	Foreign Language Theme	Not only the theme song, but the entire soundtrack of the show is in English (shown with Italian subtitles in the original version). There are only two excpetions: one of the songs, Unbelievable, has an Italian version that doesn't appear on the show, and The Magic of Love is a Bilingual Song with verses in both English and Italian.
Alex And Co	Fridge Brilliance	Most of the song lyrics include weird wording or clumsy word order. If one thinks about it, it's exactly as if they were written by teenaged non-native English speakers.
Alex And Co	Meaningful Name	Alex's surname Leoni, a derivative of leone (lion), describes his fierce, resilient nature and his position as the leader of his friend group very well.
Alex And Co	Abhorrent Admirer	While she is not abhorrent per se, Linda counts as this for Christian, since he is lowkey scared of the idea of getting close to her.
Alex And Co	Betty and Veronica	Nicole is the Betty (childhood friend and overall nice girl) and Emma is the Veronica (starts out as an intriguing stranger) to Alex's Archie. The interesting part is that both are equally Girl Next Door- esque, and that Emma has the blonde hair- blue eyes combo usually associated with Betty, while Nicole is a dark-eyed brunette like Veronica.
Alex And Co	Cannot Spit It Out	Nicole about her crush on her childhood friend Alex. Of course, the main reason is I Don't Want to Ruin Our Friendship, complemented by the fact that Alex is too busy swooning over Emma.
Alex And Co	Fantasy-Forbidding Father	Emma's father is this, and it's hard to defy him because he's not just any regular person.
Alex And Co	Nom de Mom	At first, Emma uses her late mother's maiden name, Castelli, to hide the fact that her father is  Principal Ferrari.
Alex And Co	Egocentric Team Naming	The band gets renamed to Alex & Co. in this season, but it is the rest of the members, not Alex, who come up with it as a tribute to their leader.
Alex And Co	Failed a Spot Check	Being overwhelmed with songwriting and rehearsals for The Talent, Alex falls asleep while writing an essay. In the morning, realising he's overslept, he hastily copies his brother's old essay, changing only the name at the front. He fails, however, to notice that his brother has also signed his paper at the end, and that is what gives away his cheating.
Alex And Co	Identically Named Group	The Lindas invoke this trope and one of the judges of The Talent lampshades it, but they are actually an aversion, since the name is actually Egocentric Team Naming.
Alex And Co	Team Title	The series title becomes this after the band is renamed from Sound Aloud to Alex & Co. in season 2.
Alex And Co	Title Drop	Naturally, lots of times after the band is renamed Alex & Co.
Alex And Co	Mr. Smith	One of the judges of The Talent has that exact name. It is likely a stage name, but this is never confirmed to be true or false.
Alex And Co	Unified Naming System	Alex & Co and The Lindas are both examples of Egocentric Team Naming, but how they are chosen is what differentiates the dynamics of the two bands. Linda has an It's All About Me mindset and forces her Girl Posse to treat her like a princess. The protagonists' name, on the other hand, shows that they recognise Alex as the leader and The Heart of their band.
Alex And Co	Artifact Title	After Christian and Sam are Put on a Bus, the band falls apart - although characters still perform occasionally.
Alex And Co	Somebody Named "Nobody"	Alex adopts the alias Nobody after his manager says that without her, he would be a nobody, as a jab at her, and goes on to become an overnight internet sensation under Nobody's mask.
Alex And Co	Bootstrapped Theme Song	The Universe Owes You One, the song Nicole writes throughout the four episodes.
Alex And Co	Continuity Nod	The Universe Owes You One references the theme song by paraphrasing the line "I speak the planet's mother tongue" into "We spoke the world's mother tongue" and title-drops All the While from season 1 and We Are One from season 2. It also includes Alex and Nicole's Arc Words "together forever".
Alex And Co	Canon Foreigner	Evelyn Riley, who replaces Rebecca as Sam's Love Interest, and her parents Pat and Mary.
Alex And Co	Movie Bonus Song	The movie features songs from the series as well as two new ones that do not appear there.
Alchemy Of Souls	Action Girl	Naksu's introductory scene shows just how dangerous she is in her original body.
Alchemy Of Souls	All Love Is Unrequited	In their youth, Park Jin and Maidservant Kim were in love, respectively, with Do-hwa and Jang Gang (who ended up marrying each other). Fortunately, they get each other as Second Love.
Alchemy Of Souls	Ancient Artifact	The Ice Stone. Among its many powers, it produces the "soul ejectors" that can make the Alchemy of Souls possible for those who are not capable of Hwansu.
Alchemy Of Souls	Artifact Collection Agency	Jinyowon serves as this for the mages of Daeho.
Alchemy Of Souls	Attending Your Own Funeral	
Alchemy Of Souls	Bed Trick	The former King used the Alchemy of Souls to swap bodies with Jang Gang with the goal of impregnating Gang's wife Do-hwa. She was unaware that her husband had swapped bodies and was seemingly never told the truth, and with Gang leaving so soon after Uk's birth it led to many believing that she had been unfaithful.
Alchemy Of Souls	The Big Damn Kiss	While it's not their first kiss, Uk and Mu-deok's kiss at the end of episode 18 after she elects not to kill him really seals the deal on their relationship.
Alchemy Of Souls	Black Magic	The eponymous Alchemy of Souls, which is about displacing souls from one body to another.
Alchemy Of Souls	Blind Seer	Jin Bu-yeon had Aura Vision to compensate for her blindness. As did Jin Seol-ran before her.
Alchemy Of Souls	Brainwashed and Crazy	Jin Mu manages to mystically compel Mu-deok into running wild and committing a massacre while in a trance.
A League Of Their Own 2022	Affectionate Nickname	Greta nicknames Jo "Joey", who in turn calls her "Bird".
Alchemy Of Souls	Broken Ace	Uk's father and former Gwanju Jang Gang was also a mage prodigy, but every bad thing that happens in the characters' back-stories resulted from his interest in the Alchemy of Souls and failing to return the Ice Stone to Jinyowon. He goes into self-imposed exile for 20 years  before finally returning a shell of his former self and his body degrading into dust as a result of his soul-shifting.
Alchemy Of Souls	The Call Put Me on Hold	Jang Uk, due his father blocking his energy gate after his birth and preventing him from becoming a mage. He gets over it pretty early into the series.
Alchemy Of Souls	Camp Straight	Park Dang-gu is quite flamboyant, but only ever shows romantic interest in women.
Alchemy Of Souls	Cannot Spit It Out	
Alchemy Of Souls	Celibate Hero	Part of Master Lee’s philosophy involves celibacy, enforced via a special tea. Not many are willing to follow in his footsteps (Heo Yeom stopped being his student specifically to get married), and even he slips from time to time.
Alchemy Of Souls	Chekhov's Gunman	The real Mu-deok initially appears to have been just a blind beggar who was in the wrong place in the wrong time. It gradually becomes apparent that she is really Bu-yeon, the Jin’s family lost daughter, who is immensely important to the plot.
Alchemy Of Souls	The Chosen One	Jang Uk, born under The King’s Star, is destined for greatness, although nobody knows if it will be ultimately for good or for evil.

Alchemy Of Souls	Death by Childbirth	Do-hwa died giving birth to Jang Uk.
Alchemy Of Souls	Diabolus ex Machina	The bells used to control soul shifters are never mentioned before the final episode of Part 1. Jin Mu handily uses them to make everything go to hell in a very short order.
Alchemy Of Souls	Disappeared Dad	Jang Gang went to walk the Earth shortly after Uk’s birth, and nobody has heard from him since.
Alchemy Of Souls	The Dragon	Gil-ju to Jin Mu. Yeom-su later replaces him in the role.
Alchemy Of Souls	Dual Wielding	Yul uses two short swords.
Alchemy Of Souls	Easy Amnesia	Jin Bu-yeon suffers from this after nearly drowning; it takes a decade for her memory to return. Then,  Naksu suffers from it after petrifying, and it takes her three years to recover her memories.
Alchemy Of Souls	Elemental Powers	All magic in Daeho originates from the power of the sky as embodied in Lake Gyeongcheondaeho. Therefore, the mages mostly use water-based spells, although particularly skilled practitioners can transform water into fire energy.
Alchemy Of Souls	Eunuchs Are Evil	This is true for Eunuch Kim, a soul shifter who serves as an intermediary between Jin Mu and  the Queen. However, It's fair to note that there are some perfectly nice eunuchs in the series, such as Go Won's personal servant Eunuch Oh.
Alchemy Of Souls	Evil Chancellor	Jin Mu, as the Assistant Gwanju, has strong Jafar vibes.
Alchemy Of Souls	Evil-Detecting Dog	Gwigu is a canine-like spirit which can sniff out soul shifters. Later, Master Lee puts it into the body of a real dog, where it retains its special abilities.
Alchemy Of Souls	Evil Hand	After conjuring his energy for the first time, Jang Uk suffers a form of Power Incontinence which is expressed as his right hand going out of control and attacking everything in sight. He uses a special bracelet to control it until the issue is resolved.
Alchemy Of Souls	Fascinating Eyebrow	The Crown Prince’s signature expression.
Alchemy Of Souls	Four-Temperament Ensemble	the “Four Seasons”, although Winter and Summer’s traditional temperaments are switched.
Alchemy Of Souls	Foreshadowing	Mu-deok ability to enter Jinyowon, which supposedly can only be opened by women of the Jin family, is an early hint to the real Mu-deok’s identity.
Alchemy Of Souls	Freudian Excuse	Jin Mu was born as an illegitimate child in a family where men don’t have much standing in the first place, and spent his youth in poverty, envying his more privileged peers. He’s very angry every time this is brought up, such as when Maidservant Kim reminisces about him stealing food while living in the Jang household.
Alchemy Of Souls	Gossip Evolution	The story of Uk’s fight with Gil-ju goes from “someone killed a soul shifter near the palace” to “Naksu was reincarnated in the body of a man and has come to exact her revenge” in a matter of hours.
Alchemy Of Souls	Grand Theft Me	The Alchemy of Souls allows one to do this, as exemplified by the old king and Naksu. We also get to see a live example with Master Kang, who steals the body of his student to avoid dying of old age.
Alchemy Of Souls	Green-Eyed Monster	Played with; the Crown Prince is clearly jealous of Jang Uk, and it motivates some of his actions later on, but he doesn't allow it to reach the point where they become intractable enemies. He even lampshades this to some of Jang Uk's less scrupulous rivals when he catches them spreading rumors, pointing out that it's foolish to allow your jealousy to draw you into making enemies out of talented and powerful people.
Alchemy Of Souls	Hermit Guru	Master Lee spends most of his time living ascetically in the wild.
Alchemy Of Souls	Hired Help as Family	Maidservant Kim very clearly functions as Jang Uk’s mother, doting on him and telling him how proud she is every time he accomplishes something. For his part, he does his best to make her happy.
Alchemy Of Souls	I Am Spartacus	Played for comedy. Mu-deok volunteers to drink the contents of a chamber pot to appease an enraged Crown Prince, only for Jang Uk, Maidservant Kim and Park Dang-gu to declare their intention to do the same. At this point, the exasperated Crown Prince gives up on the whole thing.
Alchemy Of Souls	I Ate WHAT?!	Libido-suppressing Celibate Tea, much to the male protagonists’ horror. Thankfully, the effects wear off very quickly.
Alchemy Of Souls	I Have Many Names	Both the heroine and the Jin heiress she shares a body with rack up a number of names to the point that Master Lee asks her what name she wants to be called during  her marriage.
Alchemy Of Souls	Impossible Task Instantly Accomplished	
Alchemy Of Souls	Improbable Weapon User	During their first encounter, Mu-deok threatens Uk with a crab leg.
Alchemy Of Souls	Insult of Endearment	Crown Prince Go Won dubs Mu-deok “Filthy Mu-deok” after she throws a chamber pot at him, but over time his use of the nickname clearly becomes affectionate.
Alchemy Of Souls	Iron Lady	Everybody is kind of scared of Jin Ho-gyeong, especially her daughter.
Alchemy Of Souls	Kung-Fu Wizard	What the mages in the series are mostly about. Their preferred martial art is sword-fighting.
Alchemy Of Souls	Love Dodecahedron	Let’s see. Mu-deok’s fan club includes Jang Uk, Seo Yul and Crown Prince Go Won, while Jang Uk, in addition to Mu-deok, has Heo Yun-ok and Jin Cho-yeon pining for him. Cho-yeon later moves on to Park Dang-gu, while So-i has her eye on Yul… it’s endless, really.
Alchemy Of Souls	Love Triangle	In addition to the above, the older generation also gets to enjoy some romantic entanglements with Maidservant Kim being courted by both Park Jin and Master Lee.
Alchemy Of Souls	The Magocracy	Daeho’s centers of power are controlled by powerful mage families and organizations. The actual king isn’t necessarily a mage, although the current Crown Prince is.
Alchemy Of Souls	Mama's Baby, Papa's Maybe	There are many rumors surrounding Jang Uk’s parentage, the most common being that he is a result of an affair between his mother Do-hwa and an unknown man. The truth is slightly more complicated, as he was conceived by the former king using Jang Gang’s body, with Do-hwa being none the wiser.
Alchemy Of Souls	Manipulative Bastard	While doing so for benevolent purposes, Jin Seol-ran has been manipulating both Mu-deok and Jang Uk since episode 1.
Alchemy Of Souls	The Man Behind the Man	The real Danju is  the Queen, or should we say Shaman Choi in the Queen’s body.
Alchemy Of Souls	Matriarchy	The Jin family is matrilineal and controlled by the oldest daughter of each generation, with male spouses serving only as consorts. They also have an Amazon Brigade for a guard.
Alchemy Of Souls	Mark of the Supernatural	Soul shifters have a tell-tale blue mark on their body. With Mu-deok, it uniquely expresses itself as Occult Blue Eyes.
Alchemy Of Souls	Meaningless Villain Victory	Go Won is more of an antagonist than a villain, and Seo Yul certainly isn't a villain; but Seo Yul defeating Jang Uk in the 10th and final fight of his bet with Go Won is still treated this way. While Go Won won his bet, none of the things involved were remotely as important as the fact that Jang Uk reached Chisu.
Alchemy Of Souls	Meet Cute	What essentially happens between Maidservant Kim and Master Lee when he rescues her from falling into a pond and magically recovers her lost shoe.
Alchemy Of Souls	Mirror Monster	A magic mirror kept in the Jin vault lures people who look into it, swallows them into some sort of pocket dimension and spawns doppelgängers who go on to beguile those close to them. Jang Uk refuses to fall for its bullshit, and it ends up being shattered.
Alchemy Of Souls	Missing Child	Jin Bu-yeon, the eldest daughter of the Jin clan, disappeared years ago. Her father spends most of his time searching for her. Or pretending to, at any rate.
Alchemy Of Souls	Mundane Utility	Master Lee uses his high-tier supernatural powers, which only a handful of people in the setting have ever attained, to do things like chop wood, fan cooking fires, and dry clothes.

Alchemy Of Souls	Surprisingly Realistic Outcome	You'd expect that the hero mastering a new stage, reaching chisu, and learning several new techniques would allow him to win the climactic tenth duel with Seo Yul that these things were leading up to (and the bet that led to all this)... but Seo Yul had reached Chisu long before Jang Uk, had far more combat experience, and was the strongest mage of his generation in Songrim.

Alchemy Of Souls	The Fettered	Despite having enough power to do pretty much whatever he wants, Uk chooses to obey the orders of the Royal Family and the Unanimous Assembly and use it only to hunt soul shifters.

A League Of Their Own 2022	Defeating the Cheating Opponent	In their first night game,  Carson & Lupe confront the umpire when they realize that the left field lights are being turned off when it's their turn to bat, done at the behest of the opposing team's coach who has been exploiting his influence over the home field.

A League Of Their Own 2022	Distinction Without a Difference	One of the complaints that "Dove" Porter has about people only ever remembering that he hit a bird with a pitch in his short time playing in the major leagues is that the bird was actually a pigeon, not a dove.

A League Of Their Own 2022	Hiding Your Heritage	The Mexican-American Lupe García is labelled the 'Spanish Striker' by the management and press, since saying she is of Spanish descent instead of Mexican is easier for the public to accept.

A League Of Their Own 2022	Homage	Carson's introduction to the secret gay bar recreates Dorothy's introduction to Oz in The Wizard of Oz.

Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	Put on a Bus	Several:
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	Recycled Script	nd Better by a Different Name: The Season 4 (production order) (or 7 in broadcast order) opener "Höllenfahrt auf der A4" features pretty much the same story as 1997 TV movie Runaway Car starring Judge Reinhold. After a young woman in a Mercedes accidentally hits Tom, who is biking to work, with her Mercedes, she offers him a ride, but on the Autobahn at 160 km/h, the car's brakes suddenly fail with no way of stopping it. However, while the original TV movie was largely a fluke and Reinhold named it one of the worst movies he had ever done, the episode is often considered to be one of the best in the series.
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	Retcon	Many flashbacks, especially those to ca. 1995-1998. Back in the day, the series were filmed in Berlin-Brandenburg area. Especially many at the beginning of "Cobra, übernehmen Sie!" aired April 7, 2016:
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	Road Block	Most cases, these end up in vehicular carnage (watch "Unter Feuer," "Die dunkle Seite).

Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	The Schlub Pub Seduction Deduction	"Operation Hiob" is an interesting aversion of this trope. When the gorgeous, rich and highly intelligent Doctor Marlies Eisner falls for plucky cop Dieter Bonrath, everyone, including the viewer thinks she is pulling him, and must be up to something. Even Dieter himself gets convinced of that eventually. However, as it turns out, Marlies genuinely loves him, and as she has terminal cancer, wants to spend the rest of her days with an honest, caring man.
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	Shout-Out	"Rhein in Flammen" featured what might be called a "Miami Vice tribute montage," complete with the theme music.
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	Skeleton Key Card	Autobahnpolizei ID cards seem to be quite useful for this.
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	Slo-Mo Big Air	With all the wrecks that happen on this show, and all the cars that somehow reach new heights.
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	Spin-Off	A spin-off series titled "Alarm für Cobra 11 - Einsatz für Team 2" (aka "Use for Team 2") was launched in 2003, however, it only ran for two seasons and 11 episodes (in contrast with the original show which has 300+ episodes).
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	Tall, Dark, and Handsome	Tom Kranich, Chris Ritter, and Ben Jäger.
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	Tank Goodness	The stolen Leopard 2 main battle tank in "Ein Leopard läuft Amok."
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	Terrible Pick-Up Lines	Ben Jäger tries a terrible (but funny) pick-up line on Kim Krüger when they first meet, much to her inconvenience. The next day Ben is shocked to find that she is actually his new boss.
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	The Reason You Suck	Speech: Partially averted in "Vermächtnis." Semir's berating of Kim Krüger at her grave (over a grudge that has lasted through the latter half of the episode's season) ends when a passerby offers him a flower, which he respectfully, and somberly, passes to his former chief.
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	There's No Kill like Overkill	The first big action sequence in "Auf eigene Faust." A police convoy carrying a key witness to the courthouse is shot up by associates of the organized crime boss on trial—using attack helicopters.
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	Tone Shift	In the first ten years or so the tone was basically the same: high adrenaline action with spectaular chase scenes, fun romps and buddy cup humor. When Tom Kranich died and Chris Ritter came in, the tone became slightly darker and more serious. However, in the Ben Jäger years, the series got more comedic than ever, with deliberately over-the-top action scenes. With Ben's departure and the arrival of Alex Brandt, the tone became a lot Darker and Edgier and episodes featured much less car chases and more drama. A large portion of the audience disliked the change (and still hoped for Ben's return), so the producers fired Vinzenz Kiefer (Alex) and got Paul Renner as Semir's partner, who was much closer to Ben's personality. Cue Daniel Roesner (Paul) leaving three years after, and we're back to the grittiness that Chris and Alex brought.
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	Translation Convention	The Japanese cult members in "Das Ende der Welt", the Brazilian mobsters in "Das Aupairgirl", and the American cops in "Der Wettkampf" converse in perfect German even when they're among themselves.
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	Treasure Map	"Die schwarze Madonna", a charming mash-up of Indiana Jones and The Maltese Falcon on the Autobahn with ninjas and Stuff Blowing Up!
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	Undercover Cop Reveal	Happens quite often.
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	Under the Truck	Often done during pursuits. All the more impressive is that it's often done with a car.
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	Vacation Episode	The feature-length episode (and season 30 premiere) "72 Stunde Angst" takes place and was filmed in Istanbul, Turkey.
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	Vitriolic Best Buds	Dieter Bonrath and "Hotte" Herzberger.
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	Wacky Marriage Proposal	Happens in "Highspeed", when Klaus Weller shows off a spectacular way to propose to his girlfriend Tina; he drives down the highway at 230 km an hour with a fake license plate on the car and wearing a rubber pig mask, a climbs out the car's sunroof and perches on the top of the vehicle, pulling back his jacket to reveal a T-shirt with the message in German "Tina, do you want to marry me?" Of course, this causes a spectacular traffic pileup behind Klaus, but he gets away with it unscathed.
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	Western Terrorists	Played straight in "Engel des Todes;" subverted in "Das Ende der Welt," where the baddies are based in Japan.
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	Wet Blanket Wife	Andrea, who constantly tries to convince Semir to leave his dangerous job and spend more time at home with his family. Of course, it's completely futile. Eventually, she divorces him because of this (but they re-marry a few years later).
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	When All You Have Is a Hammer…	The resolution to most episodes seems to require a high-speed chase down the nearest Autobahn.
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	With My Hands Tied	In "Hals- und Beinbruch", Semir nearly defeats a bad guy in hand-to-hand combat despite having one leg in a cast.
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	Word Salad Title	Averted. It may look like one without the umlaut, but it merely translates as "Emergency for Cobra 11".
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	You Have Outlived Your Usefulness	Happens often to people who help the villain(s)-of-the-week. (examples: "Das Komplott", "Das Ende der Welt", "Zerbrochen", "Operation Hiob", etc...)
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	You Have to Believe Me!	In "Das Ende der Welt", Sturmi uncovers a plot by a Japanese Apocalypse Cult to unleash a deadly virus and kill most of the world population. Of course, when he reports it, everyone thinks he's crazy - it doesn't help his case that he's a conspiracy theory nut, who bumbles endlessly about secret worldwide plots whole day long.
Alarm Fuer Cobra 11	You Look Familiar	Several cases:
Alaska Daily	Amateur Sleuth	Eileen and the other reporters are more often doing this than what real reporters might do. For example, encounters with sources in the journalism world is about fact collecting rather than attempting to intimidate them into making statements.
Alaska Daily	Big Beautiful Woman	Claire Muncy.
Alaska Daily	Break the Haughty	Eileen starts off riding high as a superstar reporter and by the opening credits, her reputation is in tatters to the point an Alaskan newspaper is all she can work for.
Alaska Daily	Cerebus Syndrome	Eileen at first doesn't seem intimidated by verbal threats made by an unseen man nicknamed "Concerned Citizen". It is not until the end of "You Can't Put a Price on a Life" where she finally sees that person is as dangerous as he says he is when he shows up to her office and holds her at gunpoint at the end of "You Can't Put a Price on a Life". The episodes after this one also deal with blowback from earlier cases, and questions about the paper's future.
Alaska Daily	City Mouse	Big city, fast moving, energetic reporter Eileen in slower paced Alaska resembles the trope.
Alaska Daily	Cliffhanger	The show was delayed several months after the hostage situation described above. The following episode shows the outcome.
Alaska Daily	Determinator	Eileen will stop at nothing to get the scoop, even if it will end her job.
Alaska Daily	Driven to Suicide	Jordan Teller commits suicide via airplane crash once his embezzlement is exposed.
Alaska Daily	Ensign Newbie	Stanley appears to give Gabriel stories in a sink-or-swim manner.
Alaska Daily	Fish out of Water	As part of the effort to paint Alaska is a wholly different setting than the contiguous United States and an interesting locale, the cultural differences between Eileen and the rest of the staff are emphasized.
Alaska Daily	From New York to Nowhere	About as straight an example there is. Eileen lives in New York, sees Alaska as a huge step down.
Alaska Daily	I Work Alone	Eileen says these exact words. Since the other reporters know the area better, she doesn't act this out in practice.
Alaska Daily	Knight of Cerebus	"Concerned Citizen" establishes himself as this at the end of "You Can't Put a Price on a Life".
Alaska Daily	Missing White Woman Syndrome	The show revolves on how law enforcement neglects attention and effort to crimes against indigenous women. Roz even lampshades the trope in the first episode by saying that the show's main victim, Gloria Nanmac, would have been strongly believed to be murdered and presented all over CNN if she was a blonde Caucasian girl.
Alaska Daily	Modesty Bedsheet	Eileen wakes up naked in bed with Jaime in the first episode.
Alaska Daily	One Degree of Separation	Several reporters with some stories
Alaska Daily	Scenery Porn	There are a lot of exterior shots of the grandiosity and vast tundra of Alaska. Particularly in the third episode where Eileen and Roz ride a small plane from town to town.
Alaska Daily	Suicide by Cop	How Concerned Citizen gets killed. Points an empty gun at Eileen, gets shot by police sniper.
Alaska Daily	The Voice	Eileen gets harassed and threatened by an unknown caller that goes by "Concerned Citizen". He is never seen physically until the end of "You Can't Put a Price on a Life" where he holds Eileen hostage at gunpoint.
Alaska Daily	Unresolved Sexual Tension	Reporter Gabriel and subject Erica Block. Although the relationship is supposed to be professional, there's a fair amount of what can be read as giggling or flirting. Additionally, the music in the background seems to connote an emotional moment between the two. Of course, it's taboo to use a reporting job to hit on subjects, so it's for the better that Gabriel didn't act on it.
