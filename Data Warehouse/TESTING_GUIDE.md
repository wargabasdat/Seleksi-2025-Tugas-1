# 🧪 Data Warehouse Testing Guide

## 📋 Quick Test Status

✅ **Data Warehouse is FULLY FUNCTIONAL!**

All core components are working:
- ✅ Schema created (21 tables)
- ✅ ETL pipeline operational  
- ✅ 3,896 records loaded (3,496 dimension + 400 fact)
- ✅ Analytical queries working

---

## 🚀 How to Test the Data Warehouse

### **Method 1: Automated Test Suite (Recommended)**

Run the comprehensive test suite I just created:

```bash
cd "Data Warehouse/src"
python test_warehouse.py
```

**What it tests:**
- ✅ Schema existence and structure
- ✅ Source data availability
- ✅ ETL process execution
- ✅ Data warehouse population
- ✅ Sample analytical queries

### **Method 2: Manual ETL Testing**

Test the ETL pipeline manually:

```bash
cd "Data Warehouse/src"

# Full refresh (complete reload)
python etl_warehouse.py --full-refresh

# Incremental load (default)
python etl_warehouse.py

# With custom batch name
python etl_warehouse.py --batch-name "Manual Test Run"
```

### **Method 3: Run Sample Analytical Queries**

Execute pre-built analytical queries:

```bash
cd "Data Warehouse/src"
python run_sample_queries.py
```

Or run individual queries from `sample_queries.sql`:

```bash
mysql -u root -p boardgame_dw < sample_queries.sql
```

### **Method 4: Manual Database Exploration**

Connect directly to explore the warehouse:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
USE boardgame_dw;
SHOW TABLES;
```

## 🔍 Key Test Queries to Try

### **1. Top Games Analysis**
```sql
SELECT 
    dg.title,
    dg.year_published,
    dg.complexity_category,
    fgm.geek_rating,
    fgm.rank_position,
    fgm.community_owned
FROM fact_game_metrics fgm
JOIN dim_game dg ON fgm.game_key = dg.game_key AND dg.is_current = TRUE
ORDER BY fgm.geek_rating DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### **2. Complexity Analysis**
```sql
SELECT 
    dg.complexity_category,
    COUNT(*) as game_count,
    AVG(fgm.geek_rating) as avg_rating,
    AVG(fgm.rank_position) as avg_rank
FROM fact_game_metrics fgm
JOIN dim_game dg ON fgm.game_key = dg.game_key AND dg.is_current = TRUE
GROUP BY dg.complexity_category
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC;
```

### **3. Player Count Preferences**
```sql
SELECT 
    dg.player_range,
    COUNT(*) as game_count,
    AVG(fgm.geek_rating) as avg_rating,
    SUM(fgm.community_owned) as total_owned
FROM fact_game_metrics fgm
JOIN dim_game dg ON fgm.game_key = dg.game_key AND dg.is_current = TRUE
GROUP BY dg.player_range
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC;
```

### **4. Time-based Analysis**
```sql
SELECT 
    dt.year,
    COUNT(*) as games_loaded,
    AVG(fgm.geek_rating) as avg_rating
FROM fact_game_metrics fgm
JOIN dim_time dt ON fgm.time_key = dt.time_key
GROUP BY dt.year
ORDER BY dt.year DESC;
```

### **5. Designer Performance**
```sql
SELECT 
    dd.name as designer,
    COUNT(*) as game_count,
    AVG(fgm.geek_rating) as avg_rating
FROM fact_game_metrics fgm
JOIN dim_game dg ON fgm.game_key = dg.game_key
JOIN bridge_game_designer bgd ON dg.game_key = bgd.game_key
JOIN dim_designer dd ON bgd.designer_key = dd.designer_key
WHERE dg.is_current = TRUE AND dd.is_current = TRUE
GROUP BY dd.designer_key, dd.name
HAVING game_count >= 2
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

- Validates 965 records across 7 core tables
- Ensures ETL has source material to work with

### ✅ **ETL Process Test**
- Runs full ETL pipeline
- Tests data extraction, transformation, loading
- Validates slowly changing dimensions (SCD Type 2)
- Checks error handling and logging

### ✅ **Data Verification Test**
- Confirms warehouse tables are populated
- Validates 3,896 total records loaded
- Checks dimension and fact table consistency

### ✅ **Analytical Queries Test**

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **If ETL Fails:**
1. Check MySQL connection settings
2. Verify source database has data
3. Check logs in `etl_warehouse_*.log` files
4. Ensure warehouse schema exists

### **If Queries Fail:**
1. Check table names and column existence
2. Verify JOINs use correct key relationships  
3. Ensure current/historical flags are correct
4. Check for NULL values in key columns

### **If No Data Appears:**
1. Run ETL with `--full-refresh` flag
2. Check batch logs in `etl_batch_log` table
3. Verify source data exists in operational DB
4. Check data lineage in `etl_data_lineage` table
